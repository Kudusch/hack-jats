Drawing on a survey of 2598 journalists from eight South Asian, Southeast Asian, and sub-Saharan African countries, which was conducted as part of the Worlds of Journalism Study, this study assesses the importance journalists ascribe to three key development journalism roles\u2014social intervention, national development, and educating people. It also compares these perceptions across the countries, between government- and privately owned news media in these countries, and between these countries and 19 Worlds of Journalism Study countries in Western Europe and North America, which profess to adhere to an objective and democratic press function. Findings suggest that journalists from the eight countries, across government- and privately owned media, considered development journalism important, and detached, adversarial journalism as less important. Their rating of the latter roles differed considerably from those of journalists from the 19 comparison countries. Results suggest that journalists were more likely socialized into their roles rather than being forced into the same by the heavy hand of government.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The concept of development journalism, the idea that journalism may aid national development, attracted considerable attention in the literature during the 1970s and 1980s, and remains an important and relevant topic in many media systems across Africa and Asia today. For decades, the relationships between media and governance (Kalyango 2011), media and modernization or development (Aggarwala 1978; Skjerdal 2011; Hanusch and Uppal 2015), and media and socioeconomic welfare (Domatob and Hall 1983; Gunaratne and Hasim 1996; Shafer 1998) have been a central focus of studies that theorize normative models of journalism and empirically explore how these models may be reflected in practice.", "While past research has attempted to explicate the concept (Fair 1988; Shah 1996; Romano 1998) and has examined its practice in actual news content (Wong 2004; Cenite et al. 2008), it has tended to focus on individual national contexts. Few studies have adopted a comparative perspective. To contribute to a universal understanding of development journalism, both in general and in its particularities, this study assesses the relative importance that 2598 journalists in eight developing countries ascribed to three development journalism roles\u2014interventionist, developmental, and educational\u2014among 21 roles. The eight Asian and sub-Sahara African countries are Bangladesh, Botswana, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Malawi, Malaysia, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania, where development journalism would be a relevant orientation towards journalistic practice.", "The study also compares importance ratings by journalists across government- and privately owned news media in these countries, as well as between the sample countries and selected Western European and North American countries (heretofore, the West/Western).", "This study is based on selected data from the Worlds of Journalism Study (WJS; http://www.worldsofjournalism.org/). A collaborative effort of researchers from about 65 countries to assess the state of journalism in these countries, WJS\u2019 goal is to better understand journalistic cultures. The purpose of this article is to understand one aspect of journalistic cultures, i.e., journalists\u2019 role orientations, and in particular, their role orientations related to development journalism. News media in the eight countries of interest more or less shared two features. They worked under a policy articulated by their governments that news media were partners in government efforts to develop their countries as these countries emerged from colonial control and other similar conditions. Also, they all more or less had some sort of constitutional guarantee of a free press but these guarantees were interpreted differently and not always allowed in practice. Given these conditions, the question of how journalists negotiate their roles becomes important in terms of their normative beliefs."]}, {"title": "Rise of Development Journalism", "paragraphs": ["The normative idea of development journalism began in developing countries as an attempt to harness the work of journalists towards meeting development objectives, such that they become purveyors of information that spurs upward economic, infrastructure, and social mobility and growth in their societies. Some of the literature suggests that the idea was first discussed in a 1964 seminar convened by the East West Center in Honolulu (Jayaweera and Ariyante 1987), and came to be known as \u201cdevelopmental journalism\u201d in the Philippines (Stevenson 1994, 239). Communication scholars began to use the phrase under the auspices of the Press Foundation of Asia, in Manila, Philippines (Gunaratne and Hasim 1996). In 1968, the Thomson Foundation sponsored the Economic Writers Training Course in the United Kingdom, during which the seminar chairman, Alan Chalkley (1968), coined the term \u201cdevelopment journalist\u201d (Gunaratne and Hasim 1996). It became increasingly utilized because it was useful for disseminating information from agricultural extension communicators to peasant farmers and other national development enterprises in the Global South (Shafer 1998).", "The term \u201cdevelopment journalism\u201d is occasionally distinguished from \u201cdevelopmental journalism.\u201d In Ethiopia, for example, the Amharic term for \u201cdevelopment journalism\u201d denotes the overall philosophy of the framework, while \u201cdevelopmental journalism\u201d expresses the practice, equivalent to \u201cdevelopment(al) reporting.\u201d Edeani (1993) views \u201cdevelopmental journalists\u201d as government-supportive and critical of popular participation, in contrast to \u201cdevelopment journalists\u201d who encourage democratic engagement. For the most part, the two terms are used interchangeably in some literature (Seng and Hunt 1986; Odhiambo 1991; Edeani 1993), with \u201cdevelopment journalism\u201d growing in usage after 1990. Along this line, the current contribution uses \u201cdevelopment journalism\u201d as an inclusive term and one that denotes both theory and practice."]}, {"title": "Conceptualizing Development Journalism", "paragraphs": ["The rise of development journalism led to considerable debate and discussion about the actual nature of this concept and its practice. At one end were views that the concept was simply a fig leaf to hide government strong-arming journalists into covering leaders and country positively. Freedom House\u2019s views, as articulated by Sussman (1981), reduced development journalism to simply a tool of authoritarian governments to ensure they remained in the seat of power. Some scholars too pointed out that development journalism is at odds with Western thinking and philosophy (Seng and Hunt 1986; Odhiambo 1991); that it is not objective and independent of government and is about media professionals serving at the will of government agencies (Shafer 1998).", "At the other end were more benign interpretations of the concept. Aggarwala (1979), among the first to attempt a definition of development journalism, considered it a journalism that focused on grassroots development issues including critical appraisal of policy (see also Shah 1988). Shafer (1998, 42) defined development journalism as \u201cthe art and science of human communication applied to the speedy transformation of a country and the mass of its people from poverty to a dynamic state of economic growth that makes possible greater social equality and the larger fulfillment of the human potential.\u201d Also, Gunaratne (1998), Lent (1981), and Massey and Chang (2002) present development journalism as a practice in which media practitioners and government work together as partners in national development. Wong (2004, 37) too argues that the idea is to have government\u2013media partnerships to \u201cpromote the larger good of social harmony and stability together with economic growth and development.\u201d", "There is also the question of the concept\u2019s ideological exclusivity. Some scholars see development journalism as a response to particular demands in post-colonial societies that wanted to make development strides after the lost decades under colonial rule (Domatob and Hall 1983; Rampal 1984). This argument is modified by others who stress that development journalism may not be exclusive to the South as it bears resemblance with acquainted frameworks and models that originated elsewhere, such as public journalism (Gunaratne 1996; Shafer 1998), peace journalism (Shinar 2007), public service broadcasting (Banda 2007), appreciative-cum-solutions journalism (Manda 2013), and more generally the social responsibility theory of the press (Ogan 1982). All these frameworks highlight the utility of the practice of purposeful journalism.", "It is evident then that the definition of development journalism has been shifting over time and space. In fact, Solomon (2014) noted that development journalism in Tanzania changed from a top-down, authoritative approach in the socialist era to a more liberal and public service-oriented style in the contemporary democratic age. Still, there are certain characteristics that may be distilled from the various definitions of development journalism: the interventionist, the developmental, and the educational.", "That development journalism is interventionist implies that it seeks to challenge the status quo by advocating for social change. Within an interventionist journalism philosophy, the argument is that it is legitimate for reporters and editors to serve as change agents for the greater good of society. However, for development journalism, the change ought to be directed towards social, economic, and cultural development. This points to the second quality of development journalism, which is defined as the developmental function. Among all characteristics of development journalism, this may be regarded as the central requirement. It implies that the media are regarded not as spectators to social progress, but as active contributors. Also, development journalism is recognized by a strong educational function. This implies that media assume a particular responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis the citizenry, which is to inculcate knowledge and understanding concerning society and development."]}, {"title": "Media Ownership and the Practice of Development Journalism", "paragraphs": ["Given both the critique of development journalism as government control as well as its interpretation as a benign journalist\u2013government partnership, media ownership becomes an important consideration. In government-owned media, where control is institutionalized, journalists are more likely to be socialized and could even be coerced into the practice of development journalism. Very few studies, such as Rampal (1984) and McKay (1993), have empirically accounted for media ownership to better explain journalists\u2019 role perceptions for development journalism. Rampal\u2019s (1984) study from India at the height of early development journalism, for example, identified a strong dichotomy between the privately owned print media, which had an adversary reporting style, and the government-owned broadcast media, which promoted national growth and development. The two reporting styles seemed contradictory and mutually exclusive. In Bangladesh, government-owned radio and television followed policy dictates and focused on development news such as infrastructure development, public health issues, and government-sponsored events, while privately owned print media focused on non-governmental organizations and civil society (Ullah and Akhter 2002). Throughout the history of development journalism, it is evident that the development journalism reporting style has been more associated with official media outlets and less with the private and independent media.", "In all eight countries examined here, both government and privately owned media outlets are present, enabling a meaningful analysis of the extent of development orientation across ownership types. Further, development journalism was often articulated as a policy of government in these countries, with Ethiopia having one of the most articulated policies in this regard (Ethiopian Press Agency 2008). Many Ethiopian journalists, especially in the state media, favored the idea that the media should be guided by a developmental philosophy, but they tended to be critical of the current operations of the official media which they claim to be heavily inclined towards the ruling party\u2019s political interests (Skjerdal 2011; Dirbaba 2014). In Indonesia (Romano 2003; Pintak and Setiyono 2011) and Tanzania (Kalyango 2011), newspapers (and other media) and the government shared a development agenda, creating what may be termed a partnership press. Also, even some journalists in these countries viewed journalism\u2019s function as that of supporting societal development. This was also true of Malaysia (Anuar 2005), though today Malaysian newspapers\u2019 reach has dwindled in the face of competition from online portals.", "Similar ties between government and media existed in Bangladesh (Ullah and Akhter 2002) and Malawi (Malawi Government 1998, II). In Malawi, newspapers, the source of alternative political discourse, have shrunk, leaving the country with only two publishing houses (Chitsulo and Mang\u2019anda 2011). In Botswana, while the private media did not subscribe to any such orientation, government news media had a clear national development outlook (Rooney 2012). In Sierra Leone, community radio appeared to be the medium for community participation and development (Musa 2005; Wahl-Jorgensen and Cole 2008). Journalists still need training in development reporting in Sierra Leone.", "Some other media characteristics in a few of these countries were as follows. In Ethiopia, only the 19 percent who live in cities (The World Bank 2014) are exposed to pluralistic media, while in Botswana private media are mostly an urban phenomenon. Print media ownership in Bangladesh is dominated by commercial power, manifesting de-politicization in terms of state ownership but re-politicization in terms of business ownership, what Mahmud (2013, 47) calls \u201ccorpo-politicization.\u201d The electronic media (television and commercial FM radio, in particular) are in the hands of powerful businesses that have lobbying power to influence media content, creating new limits on the diversity of voices in Bangladesh.", "In sum, while development journalism policy was not uniform across the countries, it was strongly urged, particularly in government-owned media. Consequently, and almost in all countries examined here, journalists working for private media likely practiced under different expectations and challenges than those who work for government-owned media, which may explain the volatility in quality of work pertaining to development journalism from various media houses (see Ullah and Akhter 2002)."]}, {"title": "Freedom of the Press", "paragraphs": ["Apart from the somewhat common underpin of development journalism, news media in the eight countries varied in several ways. While they included national and city newspapers, community media, and weekly magazines, as well as both radio and television, these were present at varying levels of development, reach, and government ownership and control. In some of these countries, for example Tanzania (Ramaprasad 2001), the advent of liberal economic policies and multipartyism (sometimes belatedly after independence), had led to an exponential growth of media, but this growth was not necessarily a harbinger of media freedom or quality journalism, even when the constitution guaranteed such freedom.", "In Botswana, where multipartyism and a constitutional promise of a free press were instituted immediately upon independence, the government\u2013media relationship while mostly positive is also tense at times, with detractors suggesting that the government has exhibited an \u201caversion for a free and independent press\u201d (Molefhe 2012). Since its independence in 1964, Malawi has also had \u201clegal and policy frameworks that have specific provisions to facilitate media operations, the most notable being constitutional guarantees to freedom of the press and liberalisation of airwaves, [but] the media\u2009\u2026\u2009continue to operate in a harsh political, legal and economic environment\u201d (Chikunkhuzeni 2004; see Makuwira 2006).", "Similarly, post-colonial Sierra Leone also instituted freedom of the press but since then its history has been checkered, with considerable control across different governments (Wahl-Jorgensen and Cole 2008).", "In South Africa, the constitutional guarantee of a free press came with democratization in 1994, but while media freedom \u201callowed the political communication systems to open up, new pressures were exerted by respective governments who clashed with independent media or interfered with the governance and editorial processes at the public broadcasters\u201d (Wasserman 2010, 170). Ethiopia created \u201ca constitutional and legal framework to protect press freedom and independent journalism\u201d in the 1990s, but the government has \u201cproved more than willing to contravene its own media rules\u201d (Dirbaba 2014, 2).", "In the two Asian sample countries, the situation is not too different. In Malaysia, the government, through close ties with the media, directly or indirectly controls the media (Sani and Azizuddin 2009). Journalists in Indonesia faced considerable restrictions during the Suharto years and later; today \u201cAlthough many of the laws that constrained Indonesian journalists under Suharto have been scrapped, legal intimidation and violence continue\u201d (Pintak and Setiyono 2011, 186)."]}, {"title": "Research Questions", "paragraphs": ["Past studies have identified the opportunist facilitator role, which in many regards resembles a development reporter, to be less interested in objective reporting and public investigation (Hanitzsch 2011). This is one of the common assumptions in much of the literature concerning development journalism (rooted in Western critiques of the concept), namely that its reporting style is incompatible with conventional professional ideals such as objective reporting and watchdog journalism. Several recent contributions, however, claim to detect a combination of critical and nation-building ideals within the same professional community in developing societies, for instance among journalists in Fiji (Hanusch and Uppal 2015), Indonesia (Pintak and Setiyono 2011), Bangladesh (Ramaprasad and Rahman 2006), and Nepal (Ramaprasad and Kelly 2003). It is therefore important to investigate how a journalist\u2019s commitment to development journalism may correspond with other journalistic roles. The research questions of interest in this case are: RQ1: How important do journalists in selected countries in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa view development journalism roles compared with other roles?", "RQ1: How important do journalists in selected countries in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa view development journalism roles compared with other roles?", "The literature has indicated the influence of ownership on reporting styles, wherein government-owned/controlled new media are more likely to follow the development journalism style than private media.

The method was survey and the data collection instrument was a questionnaire. A common English-language master WJS questionnaire, primarily using quantitative measures and five-point Likert scales, was developed collaboratively to guarantee the highest level of broad-based multinational validity. Where relevant, the questionnaire was translated into local languages, assuring consistency with the master questionnaire through back translation where necessary. The questionnaire also gathered information at the individual level (such as age, gender, educational level, and rank in the newsroom), as well as at the organizational level (reach of newsroom), and particularly information about ownership (private, public, and government-owned media). The questionnaire was administered face-to-face in most countries. In Malawi, questionnaires were administered via the phone, and in Sierra Leone, through an online tool. In Botswana, Indonesia, and Malawi, completed questionnaires were also received by mail and email.", "Journalists were those who had some editorial responsibility over news content (Hanitzsch et al. 2011). Freelance journalists and journalists working for alternative media, ethnic media, and alternative online sites were also included in this definition. In Malawi and Sierra Leone, volunteers were included because they are an integral part of the professional media landscape.", "Respondents were typically recruited through stratified (by rank) proportional random sampling. Response rates were generally very high with at least 75 percent of sampled journalists responding, except in Malawi, which had a response rate of 48.2 percent even though all journalists in the country were contacted. Hence, sampling adequacy overall was highly satisfactory, with a margin of error below 5 percent in all countries. The surveys were conducted between early 2013 and the end of 2015.", "Sample journalists were asked to rate each of 21 journalistic roles (in the WJS questionnaire) on a five-point Likert scale for importance in their own work, from \u201cunimportant\u201d (1) to \u201cextremely important\u201d (5). These items aimed to measure journalists\u2019 role perceptions vis-\u00e0-vis established journalistic functions such as the watchdog or entertainer roles, or detachment. Three items measured aspects of the development journalism role. \u201cAdvocate for social change\u201d measured the interventionist dimension, \u201cSupport national development,\u201d the development function, and \u201cEducate the audience,\u201d the educational role.", "For data analyses, the commonly accepted technique of centering means (Fischer 2004) was employed to counter acquiescence bias, a tendency to always answer more positively or negatively to all items in some countries, on the national level (Hanitzsch et al. 2011). First, the overall mean score across all 21 role perception items for each country was calculated; next, this mean was subtracted from each item separately to get centered scores. A positive score indicates that a particular role is deemed more important than the overall country mean, while a negative score means the role is less important. The centered scores enable a more accurate comparison of the relative importance of roles in each of the countries.", "This study includes Bangladesh, Botswana, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Malawi, Malaysia, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania as countries of interest.

Respondents were reasonably young with a mean age of 33 years, ranging from nearly 28 in Tanzania and 31 in Malawi to nearly 37 in Bangladesh.

In Ethiopia, this role was even more important than educating the audience, ranking second. In Tanzania, it ranked third, in Bangladesh and Sierra Leone fourth, and in Botswana and Malawi fifth. Indonesia (seventh) and Malaysia (ninth) assessed the role as less important. The role \u201cadvocate for social change\u201d ranked sixth overall, but considerable differences existed across countries.

Journalism\u2019s entertainment function was not considered as very important on average. Significantly, overall, journalists did not consider being a watchdog of those in power (monitoring and scrutinizing political leaders as well as business) as important as the three development journalism roles. At the same time, journalists in the sample strongly rejected the notion of journalists as opportunist facilitators (\u201csupport government policy\u201d and \u201cconvey a positive image of political leadership\u201d), assessing them very low in importance overall and in each country. They did consider as important the roles of promoting tolerance and cultural diversity, providing a forum for people to have a voice, and reporting things as they are, the latter indicating a fact-based journalism practice.", "These results therefore draw into question the idea that journalists in developing countries are merely opportunist facilitators who are cheerleaders of those in power. Instead, they perceive themselves as promoters or agents of their societies\u2019 economic and cultural development. At the same time, important differences were present across countries. In Malaysia, for example, journalists did not consider supporting national development and advocating for social change very important, but did assess \u201cbeing a detached observer\u201d as relatively more important than the two aforementioned roles.

Naturally, such a comparison is a broad brush to some extent, as there are also significant differences between different Western media systems (Hallin and Mancini 2004). At the same time, they also exhibit important similarities such as levels of press freedom and journalistic traditions, particularly when compared to the eight sample countries. A comparison of the importance ascribed to the role \u201csupport national development\u201d by journalists from the sample countries and those from the 19 Western European and North American countries studied as part of the wider WJS revealed significant differences, with Cohen\u2019s d\u2009=\u20092.71, suggesting a large effect (Table 4). Journalists from the West rated the role less important than journalists in the select sample countries.

Again, journalists from the West rated the role less important. On the other hand, no significant difference was present for \u201ceducate the audience.\u201d", "Further, journalists in the West and elsewhere were vastly less interventionist, as indicated by their much stronger support for the roles of being a detached observer and reporting things as they are. These two items showed among the highest effect sizes for differences between the two sets of countries. Large effects were also found for supporting government policy and conveying a positive image of political leadership, indicating the larger detachment role among the selected countries of the West. Additional evidence of this detachment was indicated by the finding of significant differences for the watchdog role; journalists in the eight sample countries rated the importance of monitoring political leaders and business as significantly less important than their counterparts in the West.", "These results paint a picture that is reminiscent of discussions about development journalism, which views it as being too supportive of government, not sufficiently detached, and avoiding a role as watchdog. In fact, the results actually paint a more complex picture. While it is true that journalists in the eight sample countries may reject to a smaller extent what Hanitzsch (2007) has termed the opportunist facilitator role, it is important to bear in mind that these two role perceptions were still ranked second- and third-last relative to all other roles. Comparing only centered scores for each item is thus potentially misleading; it is important to also take into account role items\u2019 relative ranking rather than their absolute scores alone. Doing so shows that the largest differences were in terms of detachment and, indeed, development journalism roles. The latter were typically ranked much lower in Western countries and elsewhere, while being a detached observer was ranked much higher."]}, {"title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["This study examined how journalists from Bangladesh, Botswana, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Malawi, Malaysia, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania perceived and approached the decades-old tradition of development journalism. Of particular interest was the relative importance of three development journalism roles described as educating the audience, supporting national development, and advocating for social change. The comparisons that were the focus of this study provided, in summary, the following results. While there were some differences by country, overall, educating the audience was the most important role among all roles; and among the three roles was followed by supporting national development and advocating for social change, in that order. Media ownership did not emerge as a major variable in the importance ascribed to these roles, and while an interaction effect was found between country and ownership, the findings did not fall into a pattern.", "The comparison between journalists from the eight sample countries and the 19 Western or developed countries\u2014from the WJS\u2019 wider sample\u2014yielded significant results for supporting national development and advocating for social change. The developing country journalists considered these roles to be more important than did their Western colleagues. This was also true for supporting government policy and conveying a positive image of political leadership. On the other hand, Western journalists rated being a detached observer and reporting things as they are as more important than their developing world colleagues.", "The results indicate that development journalism was important to these journalists, more important to them than to their Western colleagues; this was also evident in the other roles they subscribed to that are supportive of such journalism, i.e., promoting tolerance/diversity and enabling people\u2019s voices. Considering that the concept of development journalism was seeded in the developing world, these findings are not surprising. What is significant, however, is that these findings support other more recent contentions, which argue that development journalists still aim to combine developmental roles with more traditional, Western roles such as criticizing those in power (e.g., Hanusch and Uppal 2015).", "Journalists in the eight sample countries rejected roles such as supporting government policy or conveying a positive image of political leaders, albeit to a lesser degree than their Western counterparts; and they were also supportive of critical watchdog roles, albeit again to a lesser degree than Western journalists, and also with less priority than they gave to developmental roles. Thus, journalists in the eight countries placed arguably greater importance on developmental roles than on the traditional watchdog roles. But the watchdog roles were still considered as more important than loyalty or patronage related to supporting those in power.", "More evidence of this is in the ownership results; no differences were found in the importance of two key development journalism roles (support national development and advocate for social change) between government and private media journalists. These results are more in line with the root meaning of the development journalism concept as a journalism that focused on grassroots development issues (Shah 1988), including critical appraisal of policy (Aggarwala 1979), than with Freedom House\u2019s views as articulated by Sussman (1981) that development journalism is simply a tool of authoritarian governments to ensure they remained in the seat of power. Thus, the findings of this study lend credence to the idea that development journalism is more a matter of socialization into a press philosophy, given the immediate needs of developing countries and collectivistic cultures that emphasize group harmony and respect for hierarchy, than indicative of an oppressive government alone.", "For \u201ceducate the audience,\u201d the importance rating was not substantially different among the eight countries or between these and countries from the Western sample. This statement is not as specific to development journalism as the other two statements and is one that likely also belongs with the liberal democratic interpretation of journalism. Future studies on development journalism may want to consider the generality of this item before using it in their measurement for development journalism.", "Moving to more specific country situations, some of the major legacy media institutions in countries like Tanzania, Sierra Leone, and Botswana were either government-owned and later privatized or were granted licenses as commercial enterprises on conditions that their primary function was to advocate for social change, among other national development roles. For instance, in Sierra Leone, journalists believe one of their fundamental roles in their communities is to educate the public on important issues to enhance their ability to make informed decisions during crucial periods of voting on local leaders or public health concerns. Even in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Bangladesh, media institutions operate under strict national policies or press laws that require some enforcement or oversight or self-regulation to ensure that major regular broadcasts and consequential press features support government policies or emphasize content and agendas that align with ownership interests. Findings of no difference, in this study, in respondent journalists\u2019 beliefs about development journalism as well as their subscription to critical evaluation overall, however, indicate that this government hand may not be heavy but work more likely as an agent of socialization.", "The political environment plus the economic conditions, outlined earlier indicating how media organizations operate in the sample countries under ownership surveillance, are plausible explanations for the significantly large difference in terms of detachment versus development journalism roles among journalists from the eight sample countries and selected countries of the West.", "In conclusion, the findings show that whereas there are some variations between the countries both in privately and government-owned media specifically on the three development journalism roles, many journalists to a great extent still favor and highly rank the importance of educating the audience, supporting national development, and advocating for social change. This is consistent with\u2014but clearly characterized with these new findings\u2014Dirbaba\u2019s (2014), Ullah and Akhter\u2019s (2002), and Skjerdal\u2019s (2011) notion that media and journalists in this study\u2019s regions of interest are still guided by a developmental philosophy, but that ownership impacts the extent of allegiance to the philosophy with privately owned media tending to be critical of some state institutions as compared with state-owned media.", "It would appear that respondent journalists still perceive an obligation towards changing their societies for the better: socially, economically, and environmentally. But can they continue to afford to detach themselves into mere observers and expect the three roles to be a means to democracy, modernization, and development that many journalists and citizens all wish for? This and other similar \u201cwhat next\u201d questions remain unanswered. In a nutshell, development journalism still thrives in these countries, but journalists approach or perceive the three development journalism roles as either significantly different or marginally different depending on ownership type. The increasing private media ownership and the political changes sweeping through these regions as they mature in governance, modernization, and democratization, along with competition among media outlets, may be contributing to the findings concerning the three roles."]}, {"title": "DISCLOSURE STATEMENT", "paragraphs": ["No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors."]}], "references": [{"title": "A Third World Perspective on the News", "year": "1978", "journal": "Freedom at Issue", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Aggarwala Narinder K.", "first_name": "Aggarwala", "last_name": "K."}]}, {"title": "What is Development News?", "year": "1979", "journal": "Journal of Communication", "volume": "29", "authors": [{"name": "Aggarwala Narinder K.", "first_name": "Aggarwala", "last_name": "K."}]}, {"title": "Journalism, National Development and Social Justice in Malaysia", "year": "2005", "journal": "Asia Pacific Media Educator", "volume": "16", "authors": [{"name": "Anuar Mustafa K.", "first_name": "Anuar", "last_name": "K."}]}, {"title": "An Appraisal of the Applicability of Development Journalism in the Context of Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) This Paper was Presented during the South African Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s \u2018News Content Planning\u2019 Workshop on 21 October 2006, Held at the Birchwood Executive Hotel, in Boksburg, South Africa", "year": "2007", "journal": "Communicatio", "volume": "33", "authors": [{"name": "Banda Fackson", "first_name": "Banda", "last_name": "Fackson"}]}, {"title": "Perpetual Development Journalism?
