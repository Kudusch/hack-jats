Journalists work frenetically to meet \u201ctraffic quotas,\u201d are tethered to work 24/7 via smartphones, email, and group chat programs, and confront a constantly speeding-up pace of work (DePillis 2015; Segal 2015). Workers have little say in management decisions, which often seem erratic as companies respond to rapid growth and investment. Yet these media workers are committed to journalism and to the potential journalism they can create and many have turned to unions to address the growing rift between the supposed glamor of working in digital media and its material realities (Cohen and de Peuter, forthcoming).", "Scholarly research, however, has little to say about digital journalists\u2019 working conditions. Research on digital journalists focuses on journalists\u2019 professional identities and practice, including ethics, credibility, routines, and norms (Witschge and Nygren 2009; Agarwal and Barthel 2015), leading several researchers to call explicitly for research into working conditions in digital journalism (\u00d6rnebring 2010; O\u2019Donnell, Zion, and Sherwood 2016; Deuze and Witschge 2017). Even Digital Journalism\u2019s ambitious editorial agenda does not include specific mention of work or labor, although these issues lurk in many topics the journal aims to engage (Digital Journalism, n.d.)", "The explosion of recent research on work and labor in media and cultural industries (see Maxwell 2015) and the ongoing \u201cdigital labor\u201d research agenda (see Fuchs 2013) affirm the need to examine labor relations in all forms of media and cultural production to understand material conditions, attend to issues of power and struggles for social justice, and to propose policies and practices for improving working conditions and, in turn, media and culture generally. A labor perspective will become increasingly important for journalism researchers: as journalism further digitizes, conflict and struggle around the conditions of those who produce journalism intensifies, as the ongoing unionization wave in digital newsrooms demonstrates. In just two years, 24 digital newsrooms have formed or joined unions. Digital-first, or born-digital companies\u2014high-profile examples include The Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, and VICE\u2014are growing in number, spreading geographically, and are circulating \u201cunprecedented amounts of multimedia content\u201d (Daum and Scherer 2017, 2). Venture capital and investment funding is pouring into news start-ups and established companies alike (Carlson and Usher 2015). As privately owned companies, digital media outlets do not publicize revenue and profits, and journalists note that digital media companies are not meeting \u201crevenue target[s],\u201d yet commentators\u2014and especially company executives\u2014insist on digital media outlets\u2019 fortunes. VICE is valued at $5.7 billion, for example, and Buzzfeed at about $1.7 billion (Sharma and Alpert 2017). While digital media companies continue to hire journalists, they are also reorganizing, merging, and shedding staff\u2014the \u201cnew\u201d journalism industry, it turns out, looks a lot like the old. In this rapidly evolving context, we need to better understand the material conditions of digital journalism production.", "Existing academic research on the implications of digital technologies for journalists\u2019 working conditions shows that journalists face increased pace and intensity of work as they are pressured to publish instantly and continuously; are required to multitask and be multiskilled; often feel stressed, exhausted, and overworked; and that work is marked by temporal and functional flexibility, job insecurity, and uncertainty (Deuze 2007; Paulussen 2012; Reinardy 2012; Anderson 2013; Comor and Compton 2015). Many of these work pressures are not inherent to digital technologies themselves, but rather flow from management and production strategies, which now require media companies to produce massive amounts of content for a variety of media platforms\u2014over which companies have no direct control\u2014due to media concentration, declining print advertising revenue, shrinking staff, strategies of social media platforms, and competition, all stemming from for-profit logics of capitalist media production (McChesney 2013; Daum and Scherer 2017).", "Print journalists facing digitization of their work worry about journalism\u2019s public service mission as market orientation becomes more pronounced (Siegelbaum and Thomas 2015). They are concerned that journalistic autonomy, or \u201cthe ability to control the terms of one\u2019s work,\u201d is undermined (Beam and Meeks 2011, 231). Comor and Compton (2015) argue that while journalists are both empowered and disempowered by technological change, there is no question that digital technologies have a dramatic effect on journalists\u2019 work: \u201c[Technologies have] completely changed the nature of every element of what I do\u201d notes a journalist they surveyed (76). Other respondents speak to the contradictory nature of digital technologies, which have increased workloads and decreased work quality, but which have also enabled journalists to be \u201cmore flexible, creative, faster\u201d (78).", "These studies provide valuable insight into changing journalistic work. Yet they primarily focus on print journalism undergoing digitalization. Despite several vital studies addressing the nature of journalistic work in a digital age (see Steensen 2009; Bakker 2012; Neilson 2012; Agarwal and Barthel 2015; Creech and Mendelson 2015; Salamon 2016), we have a limited understanding of the work experiences of digital journalists, those who specifically work in the constant flow of online news production. Scholars need a better understanding of what the work of journalism looks like when it occurs outside of the boundaries of time, space, deadlines, and traditional formats, in the context of the specific, digital-first business models for advertising, circulation, and consumption being developed to maximize the surveillant precision and extractive potential of digital technologies.", "As a contribution to advocating for a labor-focused agenda in digital journalism studies, this paper discusses findings from an exploratory study on digital journalists\u2019 work, contextualized within existing research. After explaining my methodology, I draw on insights from interviews with digital journalists and a critical political economy framework to identify the technology-mediated structural conditions in which digital journalists labor, as well as three major characteristics shaping their work: measurability (the pronounced role of data and metrics in digital journalism), intensification (the pace and time required to work as a digital journalist), and commodification (the market orientation underpinning digital journalism). I conclude with a brief discussion of how a labor perspective can provide insight into these experiences."]}, {"sec_title": "Method", "sec_content": ["While sociology of news production and newsroom ethnographies provide in-depth, extended studies of particular news organizations (see Anderson 2013; Usher 2014), and while the more politicized methodologies of worker inquiry and co-research enable scholars to assess working conditions and collaborate with workers to transform their conditions (see Brophy 2017), I opted for an interview-based exploratory approach for this research to gain preliminary insight into working conditions across media organizations, provide insight into existing research, and establish future research questions.", "After an extended study of freelance journalists\u2019 working conditions in a digital age (Cohen 2016), I wanted to understand the labor experiences of journalists employed at digital-first organizations or those working for a media outlet\u2019s digital operations. I designed an exploratory study, which can \u201cyield new insights into a topic for research\u201d (Babbie 2007, 88, 89). I conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 12 self-identified North American digital journalists between June and December 2015, in-person (9) or via Skype (3). Although the study was open to American and Canadian journalists\u2014the digitalization of journalism has meant that increasingly Canadians are working for American-owned companies operating in Canada, such as Buzzfeed and The Huffington Post\u2014I interviewed 11 Canadians, one of whom works in the US, and one American. Interviews lasted approximately one hour and centered on four general areas: journalists\u2019 work and tasks (a typical day; what aspects of their work they like, dislike, and find challenging; hours worked; time off from work; their employer\u2019s business model; if they produce sponsored or branded content); the technologies and tools they use (social media; analytics; software and hardware; training in digital technology); their feelings about journalism and their work (how long they expect to be a journalist; concerns about the industry; how social media and analytics make them feel); and material conditions (pay; benefits; access to a union; employment status; general levels of security).", "Because the role of digital journalist is broad, still being defined, and somewhat unclear in academic research, rather than seeking out journalists with specific job titles or descriptions, I used a snowball sample method, which is useful for \u201cexploratory purposes\u201d (Babbie 2007, 185) but also meant that the definition of digital journalist remained open and that research participants could self-define. This, I hoped, would shed light on the variegated nature of digital journalistic work. I started with a personal contact who then recommended others to interview. While not a representative sample of all digital journalists\u2014which means the findings of this study are not generalizable\u2014it provides a snapshot of the nature of journalists\u2019 currently evolving roles.", "In total, I spoke with five men and seven women. Three worked at two different national newspapers, five worked at four different digital-first news sites (all prominent, recognizable companies), one worked at a national magazine, one at a small start-up, and two at a public broadcaster (I discuss job titles and descriptions below). The journalists were between 21 and 38\u00a0years old (seven were in their 20s, five in their 30s) and three identified as people of color. Ten held full-time status; one was a paid, full-time intern; and one had part-time permanent status. Two interviewees were in their first jobs and earned between $20,000 and $40,000. Two interviewees were managers and earned between $90,000 and $100,000. The remaining eight journalists had several years of experience and earned between $40,000 and $70,000. All held post-secondary degrees and six attended journalism school.", "The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded according to themes that emerged from the interviews and analyzed from a critical political economy perspective, which attends to the power and social relations that mutually constitute the production and circulation of media resources (Mosco 2009). Specifically, I employ a labor standpoint (Mosco 2009, 117), which foregrounds attention to working conditions, labor relations, class conflict, and resistance within the study of political economy of communication.", "In the following discussion, I assess common experiences among journalists performing different jobs for a range of companies and contextualize and analyze their experiences alongside existing research. I foreground journalists\u2019 voices throughout the article (all quotes have been anonymized and are from my interviews unless otherwise cited), but I also draw on quotes from journalists published in other studies and media reports as a way to connect the experiences of the people I interviewed with documented findings elsewhere. A critical political economy of communication approach enables me to link the experiences of the journalists I interviewed to the structural conditions in which they work, to the labor\u2013capital power relations shaping all work under capitalism, and to the need to historicize, contextualize, and theorize individual experiences reported by research participants. In this way, an exploratory study rooted in a critical analysis can provide insights and starting points for a labor-focused research agenda in digital journalism studies (see Babbie 2007, 89)."]}, {"sec_title": "Structures", "sec_content": ["Typically, research on work and labor in journalism examines labor relations, conflict, and struggle between workers and owners of media companies (Hardt and Brennen 1995; \u00d6rnebring 2010; Rhomberg 2012). Here, the focus is on labor\u2013capital dynamics as they stem from specific corporate ownership models and practices under a general mode of capitalist production, whereby companies exploit labor power to produce a commodity\u2014in this case, media\u2014by continually pressuring labor costs down and rationalizing production to increase profits (Braverman 1974). Contemporary labor-focused research, however, must expand to address the complex ways media corporations are entangled with new, often very powerful actors that are situated outside of the direct labor\u2013capital relationship but which have enormous influence on how media corporations operate and how journalists work. Today\u2019s media capitalism is constituted not only by media corporations\u2014which themselves are best understood as \u201cnetwork media industries\u201d (Winseck 2011, 3)\u2014but also by a network of external, digital-based corporations of various sizes and influence whose operating logics exert new pressures and forms of control on journalists. For example, digital journalists produce and aggregate content for their own organization\u2019s websites (in addition to producing for print, radio, and broadcast); turn that content into posts for social media platforms; send tweets with links to articles; monitor how readers find and engage with articles via analytics services; use social media management tools to schedule posts and monitor social media feeds; and engage with apps to write, edit audio and video, and monitor news and events. What Anderson (2013, 3) calls the journalism ecosystem today involves not just a range of institutional players\u2014journalists, media activists, bloggers, social media users, hackers, and developers (4)\u2014but companies ranging from corporate giants such as Google and Facebook to companies that build and sell news apps, social media management tools, and analytics services. A range of actors that are not primarily journalists or journalism organizations are now deeply embedded in journalistic production and have enormous influence on \u201cthe conditions under which news is created and circulates\u201d (Ananny and Crawford 2015, 193).", "Schudson (2011, xv) introduced the term parajournalists to describe the range of external sources that influence journalism, including \u201cpublic relations firms, public information officers, political spin doctors \u2026 publicity staffs.\u201d Today\u2019s parajournalists, arguably more influential on content than publicists and spokespeople have ever been, include the growing collection of technology-based companies that influence journalism\u2019s production and circulation, companies whose interests, values, and ethics may not necessarily align with journalists\u2019. Rather than providing access or information to journalists via soundbites and press releases, today\u2019s parajournalists create algorithmic programs that collect data on news circulation and consumption, platforms for distributing content, content management systems for publishing, and tools that manage other tools, such as monitoring social media feeds and tracking news outlets. The journalists I interviewed regularly use tools such as CrowdTangle, BuzzSumo, SocialFlow, Chartbeat, ScribbleLive, and Slack, for example. Vitally, as Petre (2015) reminds us, parajournalistic companies\u2019 primary aim is purely commercial: \u201cto [build] a loyal and returning audience that [the media outlet] can monetize in a variety of ways.\u201d Ananny and Crawford (2015, 195) describe an array of news apps built by \u201cintermediary technologists\u201d that are designed to accumulate profit before meeting a journalistic need. App creators, most of them engineers and programmers, view news audiences \u201cprimarily as customers\u201d and many use \u201ccrowd-sourced, participatory labor to do the work of news professionals,\u201d which can further undermine journalistic work (203\u2013204). Digital tools are pitched to journalists at conferences or via company reps, but many journalists I interviewed spend their own time researching and learning how to use digital tools via online forums and trade websites. Digital journalists embrace technologies and constantly seek tools to make their work more efficient due to enormous pressure to publish constantly and quickly.", "The most influential parajournalists are Facebook, Google, and other social media corporations that Smyrnaios (2015) identifies as the new news intermediaries, as they exert influence over \u201cthe whole ecology of [journalistic] production, distribution, and consumption.\u201d Their influence extends beyond capturing media companies\u2019 potential advertising revenue to setting journalistic standards and shaping journalistic practices. As the New Republic\u2019s former editor writes, \u201ctech companies dictate the patterns of work \u2026 their influence can affect the ethos of an entire profession\u201d (Foer 2017). (Poell 2017) calls this process platformization, whereby journalists \u201cbecome increasingly oriented towards and organized through the platform ecosystem.\u201d Journalists are bound to tech giants\u2019 ever-changing requirements. When complex and secret algorithms frequently change, journalists must quickly adjust their strategies. \u201cOne change in the Facebook algorithm throws off my entire strategy for the year\u201d says a social media editor I interviewed. Another journalist explains his company\u2019s reliance on Facebook:In the last year \u2026 Facebook tweaked its algorithm where suddenly we were getting way more traffic, because Facebook was just valuing news content over other stuff. So we were getting many more readers, which then turned into more ad dollars. So everybody was happy. But then suddenly they tweaked their algorithm again and it got restricted. Suddenly you had to really fight to get your stuff seen by readers. So that is an amount of control that is worrisome. But as far as I can tell there is no helping it \u2026 The best I can do or that we can do as an outlet is not to game the system, but to try to work with the system. So if there\u2019s a certain way of writing things that just helps on these various platforms, there\u2019s no reason not to do that because that\u2019s our main channel.", "In the last year \u2026 Facebook tweaked its algorithm where suddenly we were getting way more traffic, because Facebook was just valuing news content over other stuff.

Five had social media-specific job titles, such as social editor and associate producer of social media and trending. Three worked as editors (two for online-only content; one remotely for a newspaper), and the others held job titles that specifically referenced digital aspects of their job: cross-platform producer; partnership editor; content editor; computer-assisted reporter. These journalists\u2019 work includes researching and writing articles, editing stories, developing social media strategy, posting to Twitter and Facebook, editing and posting photos to websites and Instagram, building an audience on their outlets\u2019 social media accounts, curating their publication\u2019s homepage, and culling content from within a larger media conglomerate to cross-post and promote. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be versatile in this gig,\u201d says a writer who, in addition to writing online articles shoots video, writes social media posts, and edits and publishes images.", "The work many of these journalists do is outside the bounds of traditional understandings of journalistic work (see also Paulussen 2012; Anderson 2013; Spyridou et al. 2013). Says one interviewee, \u201cI\u2019m a trained journalist, I went to journalism school, and I use the tools of journalism every day, but I\u2019m not a journalist in the traditional sense.\u201d Another explains, \u201cI only consider myself a journalist because I\u2019m writing news and stuff. But I\u2019m not going out. I\u2019m not leaving my computer. I\u2019ve talked to people on the phone sometimes. But I\u2019m not going into the field. I\u2019d love to do more of that. I don\u2019t know if there are any opportunities for me to do that.\u201d", "Because digital journalism is tightly bound to the content, practices, and preferences of social media platforms, digital journalists produce articles that will be shared and circulated, or do the work of sharing and circulating other people\u2019s writing via social media. The journalists I interviewed produce content specifically to be shared online by writing in a tone that is \u201csilly or shareable\u201d; embed YouTube videos, tweets, and Tumblr excerpts in articles; produce articles with an eye toward metrics (more on this below), and find story ideas, subjects, and sources via social media. \u201cOur sourcing and our distribution are both social,\u201d explains a writer I interviewed. \u201cThe angle is, what will people I\u2019m engaged with on social media want to talk about or are talking about with these stories?\u201d This comment points to the normalization of journalists\u2019 reliance on social media platforms and platforms\u2019 constraining logics, whose consequences require further study.", "Willnat and Weaver (2014) reported that \u201c40 percent of US journalists said that social media are very important to their work\u201d and that 34.6 percent spend between 30 and 60\u00a0min daily engaged with social media (18). The journalists I interviewed spend far more time on social media. One writer says it takes three or four hours per day to repackage already-written news articles for distribution on a range of social media platforms. Constant engagement with social media is core to reporters\u2019 work, too. Says another writer:A lot of my news gathering \u2026 involves maybe tweeting it or maybe posting it on Facebook \u2026 In a way, it\u2019s just sort of a breadcrumb for myself. So, if it\u2019s a story I want to come back to I will have a record \u2026 not that sharing things on social media makes you an expert in any way, but it does establish a certain interest and a certain field on which you\u2019re focusing and then the people who follow you come to expect a certain thing. So, if I\u2019ve been tweeting about the Syrian refugee crisis non-stop for a week and then I write something in that field, it makes sense.

Each morning she receives an email from her editor with previous day\u2019s top-read stories, based on information collected by Chartbeat, a company that sells analytics and audience measurement data to newsrooms. The writer begins her work day by considering these analytics: \u201chow well are we doing? How well did we do yesterday? What should we focus on today?\u201d She also consults data from Google Analytics and from social media tools to understand how articles \u201care performing across the entire web\u201d and what people search for. This information not only shapes her editorial strategy, but also her feelings about her work, which range from elation when a story she\u2019s proud of is well read to anxiety while puzzling over where the next viral hit will come from. Most journalists I interviewed foreground analytics in their daily work practice and in their explanation of what their work entails. When I asked them to describe their work, journalists spoke about producing content that will be shared, read, and widely circulated. Although not asked specifically about journalistic values, throughout our interviews few journalists spoke of any particular set of journalistic values, or of producing journalism as a public service, for a certain community, or even to meet the mandate of their organizations, criteria historically assumed to drive journalists\u2019 professional commitments (Gans 2003; Singer 2008; Anderson 2013, 137, 138).", "Interviewees\u2019 perspectives reflect the developing business models of journalism companies, which are oriented toward producing huge amounts of content that will be widely circulated, read, and shared by audiences via social media, a model honed by the Huffington Post but adopted broadly across digital-first sites such as Vox and BuzzFeed and increasingly used by newspapers (Massing 2015; Segal 2015). Rates for digital advertising are low, usually based on a cost-per click, cost-per action, or cost-per thousand impressions basis (Turow 2012). And so, what industry calls \u201ctraffic\u201d is valued highly, and the attributes that make articles shareable are front-of-mind for digital journalists. Articles are designed to be produced quickly and to be shared, and all media organizations aim to duplicate successful stories and produce \u201csurefire traffic-getters\u201d (Petre 2015).", "The measurability of all of this content puts particular pressures on journalistic work as analytics become a vital force in digital news production (Anderson 2011; Usher 2013; Tandoc 2014; Dwyer and Martin 2017). Through tools such as Chartbeat, Omniture, and Parse.ly, journalists have access to information on how people consume news content, including how they arrive at a news story, how long they spend with an article, and if and how they share a link via social media. This precise feedback on audience activity is incorporated into editorial decision-making and work practices (Petre 2015; Dwyer and Martin 2017). \u201cAnalytics are front and center every day,\u201d explains a journalist I interviewed. Another says, \u201cwe all keep an eye on Chartbeat all day \u2026 so we can see when something really starts to rise and that informs a lot of our strategy in terms of how we\u2019re going to re-promote [stories] or cross promote [stories] or write more stuff about [a topic].\u201d Some journalists receive daily, weekly, or monthly reports, others have access to \u201cbuilt-in tools\u201d that provide real-time data on their work. One editor is expected to watch \u201cwhat is doing well across the site and who is visiting the articles, and understanding demographics and how long people spent on articles\u2026 I\u2019m definitely supposed to take that into account in figuring out what stories we are going to do in the future and [if we] should spend more time on this sort of story.\u201d While the journalists I interviewed do not question the need to use analytics, many grapple with having to alter their news judgment. Says a senior online editor, \u201cYou spend so many years as a journalist going on your instinct. And I think you need to have those instincts and my instincts are generally pretty good, but you never really knew what was appealing \u2026 So I\u2019ve really started creating stories \u2026 by doing the headline first. I do start to think about the creation of stories a little bit differently.\u201d", "Understanding the centrality of analytics to news organizations\u2019 operations gives insight into the working conditions, particularly how analytics can be understood as a new form of journalistic labor discipline (Anderson 2011; Bunce 2017). \u201cLike a manager standing over the assembly line with a stopwatch,\u201d writes the former New Republic editor, \u201cChartbeat and its ilk now hover over the newsroom\u201d (Foer 2017). Analytics reports are used in staff evaluations and, as Bunce (2017) notes, can manifest as reward (promotions, bonuses, raises) or punishment (shame, admonishment). Analytics are ever-present on journalists\u2019 desktop or laptop computers and on large screens prominently displayed throughout newsrooms that highlight top-performing articles. \u201cEveryone knows at all times the stories that are doing well,\u201d says one journalist I interviewed. Public pressure is internalized by workers and manifest as stress, anxiety, competitiveness, and insecurity. \u201cWorking in digital media we understand that\u2019s how things work,\u201d explains a writer I interviewed. \u201cIt\u2019s like you are valued as an employee by your traffic.\u201d", "Analytics extend beyond serving as an obsessive focus of journalists\u2019 workdays to become a \u201cpowerful influence over journalists\u2019 emotions and morale\u201d (Petre 2015), sparking feelings of self-doubt, triumph, or demoralization, for example. As Petre (2015) finds, \u201cjournalists\u2019 sense of dignity, pride, and self-worth are increasingly tied up in their traffic numbers.\u201d When a story does well, affirms one journalist I interviewed, \u201cyou do get really excited and people will praise you for it and it feels great. Especially when I do something I\u2019m really invested in and I worked hard on and I feel like it\u2019s a great story.\u201d Others find that stories that do poorly can be \u201csuper pride crushing\u201d and that analytics inspire competitiveness. Notes one reporter:\u2026[My old newsroom was] insane about metrics. You would get a daily \u2026 ranking of the entire editorial staff \u2026 and people got really competitive about it.

One key factor is that digital news has no deadlines. Liberated from the constraints of printing press deadlines or broadcast times, digital journalists continually create endless streams of media; news is up-to-the-minute and more content is published than ever before. VICE, for example, claims to publish about 6000 pieces of content per day globally (McKeon 2016). The Washington Post editorial staff produce 500 pieces of content per day online and The New York Times 230, a number that has \u201crisen by more than 35 percent this decade\u201d (Meyer 2016). Buzzfeed says it published 222 pieces of content per day in April 2016, but \u201cthat number is quickly rising\u201d (Meyer 2016).

When Gawker Media\u2019s traffic stalled at about a hundred million \u201cglobal unique visits\u201d a month in 2015, staff received a memo imploring them to work harder, start work earlier, and speed up their writing (Sterne 2015).", "Rapid production and uninterrupted workflows represent an intensification of journalistic labor \u201cparallel to the speed-ups in manufacturing industry\u201d (Larson 1980, 163).

The digital journalists I interviewed challenge normative conceptions of journalism, particularly as journalism becomes more deeply commodified, or produced explicitly for its exchange value (Mosco 2009). Social relations of commodification deeply shape contemporary journalism: most journalists I interviewed feel individually responsible for the profitability of their company, even those who work at non-profit media outlets, demonstrating how thoroughly marketized journalism has become in contemporary capitalism.", "As I\u2019ve argued elsewhere (Cohen 2016), in today\u2019s media ecosystem, individual articles or pieces of journalism are expected to act as stand-alone mini-profit centers, unbundled from the whole journalistic object (a newspaper, a broadcast) and expected to incur profit from advertisers; success is measured in numbers of shares, likes, or tweets, or direct income a piece brings in. In this context, journalistic labor is becoming distributive. That is to say that circulation and distribution\u2014the process of getting an article or video out into the world\u2014is now a key element of journalistic work, elevated by many media companies over the work of reporting, writing, and editing. As companies lay off journalists and editors and complain of declining profits, they are at the same time investing resources in people with expertise in social media, analytics, \u201caudience engagement,\u201d \u201cdigital products,\u201d and other business-degree-backed skills (see Powers 2015; Gentle 2017; for example). Most of the journalists I interviewed work primarily to circulate and distribute journalism rather than create it (five were writing original content but not exclusively), and even writers and reporters are foregrounding a distributive framework in their journalistic practice. This is important because, for one, it signals a shift in the nature of journalistic labor. As recently as 2010, \u00d6rnebring wrote that \u201cthe journalist is commonly not personally responsible for making sure that the collated and re-presented information reaches the audience\u201d (61). This is no longer true, and it profoundly re-orients journalists and journalism toward the market and commercial values: the measures of success for, say, writing a needed news article differ wildly from articles valued for their wide distribution. Critically, such a reorientation has implications for journalism\u2019s long-heralded public good status (McChesney and Pickard 2011; Gasher et al. 2016; Nadler 2016).", "When Siegelbaum and Thomas (2015) interviewed journalists about the effects of technologies on their work practices, all reported that \u201cthe changes in their industry had negatively affected their morale and lowered their expectations for the future of journalism\u201d (11). In particular, journalists felt that changes in their work routines and processes due to new technologies, increased speed, and \u201cpressures to find an immediate commercial audience\u201d undermines journalism\u2019s democratic role (13). The journalists I interviewed did not express such overt concerns in our discussions. While their concerns include accuracy, having enough time to do good work, and the challenges social media poses for verification, for example, most have accepted the pivot toward commodification as a reality if they want to work in media. As one journalist told me,If you think you\u2019re going to be a reporter and you\u2019re going to write stories and you\u2019re going to interview people and you\u2019re going to file them, then you\u2019re in the wrong generation.

This concern is linked to the offloading of responsibility of training journalists from employers onto workers: all of the journalists I interviewed came to their jobs already equipped with the technological skills required for their positions (and most note that an active social media presence was vital to securing their job). One reporter is concerned about the increased responsibility journalists have for their training:If [employers] just accept that [they] just have to do the basic training of a new journalist then [they] have no reason to pick from a very shallow pool of applicants. \u2026right now, because you are relying on people being more or less trained its goes back into that same very homogenous pool of people.

We also need greater understanding of how work and labor are shaped by the increasing use of digital tools, social media platforms, and other applications in the journalism production process (see Lewis and Usher 2013; Bell 2014; Poell 2017). Agarwal and Barthel (2015, 378) note that research on \u201cjournalistic role perceptions has identified four primary media functions [of journalists]: disseminator, interpreter, adversarial, and populist mobilizer\u201d (citing Weaver et al. 2007). But what can we learn from positioning journalists as workers?", "For one, a labor lens adds complexity and dynamic insight into many of journalism researchers\u2019 longstanding concerns. When journalists go to work for a for-profit media company, they enter into \u201cdefinite social and political relations\u201d explicitly organized around the extraction of surplus value for capital (Marx and Engels [1845] 1846, 41, cited in Fuchs 2013, 25). Understanding these relations can provide deeper insight into professional practices and norms, journalistic routines, the type of journalism being produced, and how journalists are responding to transformed conditions. Positioning journalists as workers can bring a labor process analysis\u2014the study of relations of control and contestation at the point of production (Braverman 1974; \u00d6rnebring 2010)\u2014to bear on changing journalism practices. A labor process perspective emphasizes that digital technologies do not act on their own to shape journalists\u2019 experiences, but rather are deployed in the production process in particular ways, usually in the context of capitalist news organizations restructuring to increase profits and lower labor costs (see Cohen 2015). A labor focus can assess journalists\u2019 experiences in terms of the mutually dependent but conflictual relationship between media owners and executives and journalists, as well as the consequences of this relationship on journalism as an ostensible public good. As a conceptual orientation, political economy research asks who benefits from particular transformations, practices, and decisions, and at whose expense (Mosco 2009); and foregrounding attention to journalists\u2019 labor conditions enables researchers to interrogate the power relationships underpinning digital journalism and emergent, digital-first media organizations", "While research can track changes, new pressures, and differences in digital journalism, we can at the same time identify continuities through change, recognizing that while the specific character of the work that journalists do may change, journalists are still inserted into the production process as particular actors enmeshed in particular power relations, which results in pressures being placed on their work that draw journalists further into relations of commodification. While such power relations have, historically, been framed as a relationship between media owners (capital) and journalists (labor), we must now add to analysis power players such as corporate platforms and app companies.", "Finally, a labor lens can highlight journalists\u2019 roles as actors in challenging and working to transform their conditions, often to enhance their capacities to produce journalism free from commercial and political constraints. Over the past two years, digital journalists at 24 companies in the United States, Canada and the UK have organized unions in their newsrooms. Journalists who have had little to no experience with unions have organized their colleagues, often under hostile retaliation from management, joining the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE); the NewsGuild, and the Canadian Media Guild. Gawker, the now-defunct gossip website, was an early actor in the current wave of digital media unionization when it joined the WGAE. Workers\u2019 announcement that they were unionizing praised Gawker as a good place to work and positioned a union as a collective formation that could give workers a voice in management decisions, ensure fair compensation, enable transparency around pay raises, and establish long-term viability for journalists\u2019 careers (Nolan 2015). The negotiated collective agreement (Writers Guild of America, East and Gawker Media 2016) includes benefits protections and paid time off, a policy for termination of employment, the establishment of an \u201ceditorial diversity committee\u201d to address diversity in hiring (5), and increased salaries for all bargaining unit members by 9 percent over three years (a base salary was set at $50,000) (5). Critically, the collective agreement promises journalists editorial independence: \u201cDecisions about editorial content (e.g. whether to post a story or the story\u2019s contents, headline or placement) may only be made by editorial, including the Executive Editor. Once a story has been posted it can only be removed by a majority vote of the Executive Editor, the CEO, and the General Counsel, unless required by law\u201d (4). This demonstrates deep links between working conditions and journalistic integrity.", "Another significant example of unionization has been VICE Canada. After a protracted campaign and management resistance, staff across VICE\u2019s newsroom (excluding management, finance, sales, and casual workers) unionized with the Canadian Media Guild (for a detailed study of this drive see Cohen and de Peuter, forthcoming). The negotiated collective agreement speaks to some of the pressures outlined in this article. Notably, the agreement sets a standard, \u201cregular\u201d workweek at 40\u00a0hours per week and establishes parameters and compensation for working beyond and outside of these hours. The agreement sets a minimum pay scale, increases pay for all unit members retroactively, gives a 7 percent raise over three years, standardizes practices, improves benefits, and creates formal mechanisms for workers to have a voice in management decision making. Significantly, VICE\u2019s agreement also ensures editorial independence, guaranteeing that \u201cnon-editorial\u201d parts of the company or third parties, such as advertisers, have no say in journalistic content (The Canadian Media Guild and VICE Studio Canada Inc 2016). Even after journalists are laid off, they benefit from being in a union: when The Huffington Post laid off \u201cdozens of staffers\u201d in summer 2017, 39 of them were protected by the WGAE and so received a negotiated severance package and continued health benefits (Weiss 2017). When owner Joe Ricketts suddenly closed DNAinfo and Gothamist when its journalists unionized, journalists received WGAE-negotiated extended pay, severance pay, and access to their published work (WGAE 2017).", "While it remains to be seen whose influence grows in the contemporary journalism ecosystem\u2014that of media companies, of parajournalists, or of journalists themselves\u2014it is clear that journalists are collectively responding to changing conditions in a way that will ultimately benefit journalism itself. Researching such responses, including the underlying conditions fuelling them, will also serve to further a labor-focused agenda in digital journalism studies."]}, {"sec_title": "Disclosure Statement", "sec_content": ["No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."]}, {"sec_title": "Funding", "sec_content": ["This research was supported by the Office of the Vice-Principal, Research at the University of Toronto Mississauga."]}], "references": [{"title": "The Friendly Barbarians: Professional Norms and Work Routines of Online Journalists in the United States", "year": "2015", "journal": "Journalism", "volume": "16", "authors": [{"name": "Agarwal Sheetal D.", "first_name": "Agarwal", "last_name": "D.", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Barthel Michael L.", "first_name": "Barthel", "last_name": "L.", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "The Tentative Hell-Raisers: Identity and Mythology in Contemporary UK Press Journalism", "year": "1998", "journal": "Media, Culture \\& Society", "volume": "20", "authors": [{"name": "Aldridge Meryl", "first_name": "Aldridge", "last_name": "Meryl", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "A Liminal Press: Situating News App Designers within a Field of Networked News Production", "year": "2015", "journal": "Digital Journalism.", "volume": "3", "authors": [{"name": "Ananny Mike", "first_name": "Ananny", "last_name": "Mike", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Crawford Kate", "first_name": "Crawford", "last_name": "Kate", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Between Creative and Quantified Audiences: Web Metrics and Changing Patterns of Newswork in Local US Newsrooms", "year": "2011", "journal": "Journalism", "volume": "12", "authors": [{"name": "Anderson C.
