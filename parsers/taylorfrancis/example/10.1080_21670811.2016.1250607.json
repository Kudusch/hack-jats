This paper, based on (1) a comprehensive content analysis of newspaper coverage, and (2) interviews with journalists covering stories related to surveillance in the United Kingdom, outlines a key tension between journalists\u2019 self-understandings and practices which has profound consequences. On the one hand, we suggest, media coverage contributes to normalizing surveillance by emphasizing concerns about national security and stressing the surveillance of elites, to the detriment of an interest in the gathering of \u201cbulk data\u201d on populations. On the other hand, journalists, though acknowledging national security concerns, are frequently critical of and resistant to the extent, nature and necessity of mass surveillance. Our paper suggests that despite journalists\u2019 desire to communicate the complexities of mass surveillance, the structural constraints of their professional practice\u2014in particular their reliance on official sources\u2014make it difficult for reporting to move beyond the legitimating discourses provided by these official sources.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Starting in June 2013, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden began leaking tranches of information about the surveillance activities of the US and UK intelligence agencies. Snowden\u2019s leaked files contained information about previously unknown surveillance programmes by the intelligence agencies, the NSA and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). These included the widespread gathering of \u201cbulk data\u201d from mobile phone and internet companies, encompassing both the content of communications as well as metadata (e.g. Greenwald 2014; Lyon 2014). Snowden also revealed that the intelligence agencies had spied on the activities of embassies and world leaders, including the monitoring of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s phone calls. The leaks, first published in The Guardian in the United Kingdom, The Washington Post in the United States and Der Spiegel in Germany, have occasioned extensive discussion about surveillance and raised a set of broader questions around the shifting relations between government, media organizations and citizens, as well as changing conceptions of the fundamental rights of citizens in the digital era.", "Against this backdrop, the current article looks more closely at debates over the Snowden revelations in the British media. It focuses on (1) how mainstream media reported the revelations and their aftermath, and (2) how journalists reflected on (a) their own coverage, and (b) practices of mass surveillance and their consequences. This was done through a content analysis of media coverage and interviews with journalists covering surveillance. The paper outlines a key tension: on the one hand, we suggest, media coverage contributes to normalizing surveillance by emphasizing concerns about national security, and minimizing concerns over the importance of mass surveillance; on the other hand, our interviews show that journalists, though acknowledging national security concerns, are frequently critical regarding the extent, nature and necessity of mass surveillance. They suggest that surveillance has had a detrimental \u201cchilling effect\u201d on journalism, with many having had personal experience of surveillance. At the same time, they are divided in their opinion of the quality of media coverage of the Snowden revelations, and take a dim view of public knowledge of surveillance.", "We argue that the tension between the ideological implications of coverage and journalists\u2019 own views occurs because of structural factors shaping news coverage: politicians are by far the frequently used sources in coverage, and are able to establish the framework through which events are explained and interpreted. Further, the details of practices of surveillance are highly complex and, in the eyes of journalists, difficult to communicate to the public. Overall, our paper suggests that despite journalists\u2019 desire to cover surveillance in a way that provides digital citizens with the information they need (Ruppert and Isin 2015), the structural constraints of their professional practice make it difficult for reporting to move beyond the normalizing discourses provided by official sources."]}, {"title": "Theorizing the Normalization of Surveillance", "paragraphs": ["In taking an interest in normalizing discourse, we mean to investigate the ways in which media coverage contributes to the discursive establishment and enforcement of norms of conduct (e.g. Foucault 1977). Varied forms of surveillance have become part and parcel of everyday life in contemporary society (Ganesh 2016, 167). Today, surveillance is no longer merely the work of shadowy intelligence agencies spying on individuals suspected of wrong-doing. Instead, we are all under constant surveillance\u2014often for commercial purposes\u2014through data-gathering facilitated by technologies that surround us in everyday life and are essential to our activities. Surveillance increasingly takes place through smartphones which record details of our activities, including \u201cself-surveillance\u201d through fitness and productivity technologies (e.g. Yau and Schneider 2009), and networked social surveillance through social media such as Facebook (Trottier and Lyon 2012). The rise of what Andrejevic and Gates (2014, 185) refer to as the \u201ccollect everything-approach to monitoring and intelligence\u201d has taken place not merely through the invention of new platforms, but also through the emergence of Big Data, which enables the datafication of everyday life and the emergence of the \u201cquantified self\u201d (van Dijck 2014; Swan 2013).", "Along those lines, the normalization of surveillance has taken root in the context of a \u201ccontrol society\u201d where, according to some observers, users \u201cremain relatively unconcerned with surveillance, accepting the trade-off of greater usability for decreased control\u201d (Best 2010, 5). These processes have only accelerated over the past decade or so, and were already well-established before the Snowden revelations. Murakami Wood and Webster (2009, 259) identified the growing normalization of surveillance as the result of a series of interrelated developments, including \u201cthe globalisation of surveillance, the domestication of security, the desire of the European Union (EU) to create a distinct leading role in security, and the influence of the \u2018bad example\u2019 of the United Kingdom\u201d.", "As comparative research has demonstrated, mediated debates over surveillance after the Snowden revelations have been profoundly shaped by social, historical and political contexts (Di Salvo and Negro 2016; Kunelius et al. 2015). The United Kingdom has been described as \u201can area where the normalisation of surveillance has gone further than in most other countries\u201d Murakami Wood and Webster 2009, 260). Here, practices of surveillance are particularly entrenched because of a long history of the central role of the intelligence services, as well as the ubiquity of various forms of surveillance, including close-circuit television monitoring (CCTV) (e.g. Webster 2004). This has been coupled with a growing emphasis on national security, particularly since the 7/7 London attacks in 2005. Arguments that justify the restriction of civil liberties have increased in both prevalence and significance since the attacks (MacDonald, Hunter, and O\u2019Regan 2013).", "However, these developments also reflect the globalized phenomenon of the rise of the \u201csurveillance society\u201d (e.g. Lyon 2001, 2007), driven in part by concerns about security (Birchall 2016). Around the world, governmental strategies and public debate are increasingly underpinned by processes of \u201csecuritization\u201d (Coaffee, Murakami Wood, and Rogers 2009), through which actions are justified on the basis of security threats. As Picard (2015, 37) suggested, there is a long-standing consensus in political theory that when the existence of the state is threatened, \u201cordinary morality\u201d no longer applies. Similarly, Giorgio Agamben (2005, 2) has described how \u201cstates of exception\u201d from the normal rule of law are justified by political emergencies. Over time they become the dominant paradigm of government, having been rendered \u201cunremarkable, mundane, [and] normal\u201d (Murakami Wood and Webster 2009, 262\u2013263). Perceived security threats constitute the grounds for such \u201cstates of exception\u201d and are used widely as justifications for intrusion into the privacy of individuals through practices of surveillance (Solove 2011).", "Here, we focus on debates over surveillance in British newspaper coverage. The British media system has been described as belonging to a \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cAnglo-American\u201d model (e.g. Hallin and Mancini 2004), characterized by (1) independence from political powers, (2) a control or watchdog function over political powers, (3) objectivity, (4) professional standards that reinforce the independence of journalism from other societal powers and professions, and (5) reporting functions that are distinct from those of comment and interpretation (Mancini 2005). On the face of it, this suggests a media system that stands outside ideological allegiances. However, the British newspaper landscape remains distinctive in its \u201cexternal pluralism\u201d, characterized by competing newspapers with distinctive ideological positions (Esser and Umbricht 2013, 991). It encompasses both popular and quality newspapers representing the breadth of the political spectrum. The political fault lines of the media landscape informed journalists\u2019 readings of and arguments around the Snowden revelations, especially around the central role of The Guardian newspaper in publishing the revelations (Chadwick and Collister 2014; Petley 2014).", "Nonetheless, media coverage of surveillance is first and foremost shaped by established professional routines. On the basis of the continued importance of the \u201cstrategic ritual of objectivity\u201d (Tuchman 1972), which requires journalists to refrain from expressing their own opinions and instead rely on balanced sources to put across the \u201cfacts\u201d, journalistic accounts are heavily structured by the opinions of sources. Here, the dominance of elite sources (Gans 1979)\u2014particularly politicians and their spokespersons\u2014is of vital significance. These sources have a disproportionate influence on the media agenda (Reese 1990), acting as the \u201cprimary definers\u201d who set the framework of interpretation against which all subsequent voices are forced to insert themselves (Hall et al. 2013). Journalists \u201cindex\u201d their coverage by \u201copening or closing the news gates to citizen-activists (and more generally, a broader range of views) according to levels of conflict among public officials and established interests involved in making decisions about an issue\u201d (Bennett 2005, 4). If there is political consensus around a particular course of action\u2014in this case, practices of mass surveillance\u2014these are, for structural reasons, less likely to be contested in media coverage. This means that journalism reproduces the power structure of society (e.g. Berkowitz 2009, 109)."]}, {"title": "Methods", "paragraphs": ["Given our interest in understanding how the Snowden revelations informed debates over surveillance, we traced mediated discussions of key events relating to the revelations. We used content analysis, which is widely deployed as a method for generating quantitative data describing larger samples (e.g. Riff, Lacy, and Fico 2014, 1). To aid us in constructing the sample, we produced a newspaper timeline, using the Nexis UK newspaper database. The key terms we searched for included \u201cEdward Snowden\u201d, as well as the names of the two main intelligence agencies implicated in the Snowden revelations, the \u201cNSA\u201d and \u201cGCHQ\u201d. In addition, the names of the surveillance programmes publicized by Snowden were searched for and charted across time. The results of this charting exercise were then compared against the major events from the Snowden revelations. These events were based upon timelines and resources created by the major news organizations and outlets which covered the Snowden revelations in the first instance, namely The Washington Post, The Guardian and Der Spiegel. We narrowed down our sample by focusing on key events representing peaks in coverage:(1) The initial revelations of mass surveillance, and Edward Snowden\u2019s unveiling as the source of the leaks (10\u201314 June 2013).(2) The detention of journalist Glen Greenwald\u2019s partner David Miranda at Heathrow Airport under anti-terror legislation (19 August to 15 September 2013).(3) The interception of communications in foreign embassies and European Union offices (30 June to 14 July 2013), and spying on world leaders\u2019 phone communications, in particular German Chancellor Angela Merkel (22 October to 4 November 2013).(4) The publication of the British parliamentary report into the death of Fusilier Lee Rigby, which raised debates about Facebook and social media companies\u2019 role in tackling terrorism (17 November to 14 December 2014).(5) The Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in Paris which prompted debates about digital encryption, freedom of speech, and the resurrection of the so-called \u201cSnoopers\u201d Charter\u2019 (9 January to 5 February 2015).", "The initial revelations of mass surveillance, and Edward Snowden\u2019s unveiling as the source of the leaks (10\u201314 June 2013).", "The detention of journalist Glen Greenwald\u2019s partner David Miranda at Heathrow Airport under anti-terror legislation (19 August to 15 September 2013).", "The interception of communications in foreign embassies and European Union offices (30 June to 14 July 2013), and spying on world leaders\u2019 phone communications, in particular German Chancellor Angela Merkel (22 October to 4 November 2013).", "The publication of the British parliamentary report into the death of Fusilier Lee Rigby, which raised debates about Facebook and social media companies\u2019 role in tackling terrorism (17 November to 14 December 2014).", "The Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in Paris which prompted debates about digital encryption, freedom of speech, and the resurrection of the so-called \u201cSnoopers\u201d Charter\u2019 (9 January to 5 February 2015).", "These events are not treated in substantive detail here, but rather understood as key moments which reflect shifting understandings of surveillance in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations. A more detailed discussion of our content analysis findings can be found in Wahl-Jorgensen, Bennett, and Taylor (forthcoming).", "We began sampling for each of our key events the day the first relevant story was published, and then coded all relevant stories until the end of a four-week period in UK national newspapers. We did this for all key events except for (1) the composite event of snooping on embassies and world leaders, where we selected a two-week sample for each case, and (2) the naming of Edward Snowden as the source of the leaks, where a smaller timeframe of just four days was used keep the sample manageable.", "The selection of these particular events, and the samples for each, had both advantages and disadvantages. We took this approach to focus on how broader public debates relevant to surveillance were refracted through the lens of the Snowden revelations. This strategy may have overemphasized particular elements of debates over surveillance (such as, for example, the responsibilities of social companies, which was a key theme in the stories on the publication of the Lee Rigby Report). Across all cases, we coded 538 newspaper stories, including both straight news and opinion/commentary pieces. We investigated coverage across the range of national UK tabloid and quality/broadsheet publications, encompassing different political perspectives and readerships. We coded for a range of variables relevant to surveillance debates in the aftermath of Snowden. Among other things, our content analysis examined opinions and news angles on surveillance,1 terms used to describe surveillance, sources used in new stories and the targets of surveillance.2", "To gain insight into journalistic discourses on surveillance, we interviewed a range of UK journalists directly involved in covering surveillance and the Snowden revelations. The journalists represented both print and broadcast media organizations, and different specialties such as defence, crime and technology. For the newspaper journalists that constituted the majority of our interviewees, we included individuals working at both quality and popular newspapers, as well as publications representing the breadth of the political spectrum. First, print journalists who wrote two or more articles included in our content analysis sample were contacted. Other interviewees were approached following Web searches around the five case studies. This presented the opportunity to contact and interview investigative and broadcast journalists who had covered these cases. The sample consisted of 11 journalists. Interviews were carried out in person (1) or via Skype (10) between October and December 2015, lasting on average 40 minutes. Our interview schedule involved a series of open-ended questions focused on themes including (1) the journalists\u2019 experience working on stories about surveillance; (2) their reflections on the Snowden revelations, their media coverage and implications for press freedom; and (3) the impact of surveillance on their work. This allowed us to explore professional reflections on the patterns in coverage revealed in the content analysis. These were elite interviews (Morris 2009), premised on accessing individuals who had direct experience of the studied context, and were placed in a position to articulate their own interpretation of that context (Kezar 2003, 397). The interviewees are listed in Table 1. Interviews were analysed to reveal key themes in journalistic discourses around surveillance."]}, {"title": "Newspaper Coverage: Normalizing Surveillance", "paragraphs": ["Our research demonstrates an interesting pattern. On the one hand, newspaper coverage contributes to the normalization of surveillance by suggesting that it is necessary in the interest of national security, and by most frequently identifying political elites as the targets of surveillance. On the other hand, journalists are personally highly critical of practices of mass surveillance, and dubious about public knowledge of the extent of mass surveillance identified by Snowden. We begin by discussing the newspaper coverage of the revelations, followed by evidence from interviews with journalists.", "As Figure 1 demonstrates, our sampling strategy resulted in a spread of stories across the five case studies, with a somewhat larger proportion of stories about the first three, which included the initial revelations, the surveillance of world leaders and embassies, and the detention of David Miranda. This coverage, however, was not evenly distributed across newspapers. The Guardian\u2014itself implicated in the coverage through its central role in the initial publication of the revelations, as well as in the story surrounding the detention of David Miranda\u2014published more stories about all of the cases than any other newspaper. The paper published more than twice as many stories (153; 28.4 per cent of total sample) as the second-most prolific of newspapers, the Daily Telegraph (with 69 stories; 12.8 per cent of the total sample).", "Figure 1  Distribution of articles across case studies", "Figure 1  Distribution of articles across case studies", "Although the case studies dealt with very different aspects of surveillance, they encapsulated key debates on the topic as they evolved over time. In our coding, we examined the most frequently expressed opinions around surveillance expressed by sources in the stories, as shown in Table 2.", "The most frequently expressed opinion was that surveillance should be increased or is acceptable/necessary (9 per cent of opinions). Sources expressing this view suggested that surveillance is crucial to national security, and particularly important to strengthen in the light of terrorist threat. For example, Colonel Tim Collins, a former SAS officer, wrote an opinion piece in The Sunday Telegraph on January 11, 2015. In this piece, he stated:The reality is that Islamic fundamentalists have seized the modern tools of communication to facilitate their murderous campaigns. Governments\u2014whose first responsibility is to defend their citizens and subjects\u2014must fight to identify and prevent these campaigns using every method available.", "The reality is that Islamic fundamentalists have seized the modern tools of communication to facilitate their murderous campaigns. Governments\u2014whose first responsibility is to defend their citizens and subjects\u2014must fight to identify and prevent these campaigns using every method available.", "The prominence of opinions that justified surveillance in the name of national security in mainstream media is not accidental. Rather, as suggested above, there is evidence for a longer-standing legitimation of state interventions through reference to security concerns. A similar position was encapsulated in the view of the leaks as compromising the work of the intelligence services, which appeared as the third most frequently expressed opinion (6.1 per cent of opinions). These views highlighted the key ways in which arguments over national security were used to justify and normalize mass surveillance. Such positions were, to some extent, countered by views critical of surveillance (7.1 per cent of opinions) and calling for the intelligence services to be more accountable and transparent (6.1 per cent of opinions), even if these were less frequent than those supportive of surveillance. Boris Johnson, then Mayor of London, was quoted in a Guardian article as follows:\u201cI think the public deserves to know,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThe world is better for government being kept under the beady-eyed scrutiny of the media and for salient and interesting facts about public espionage being brought into the public domain.\u201d (The Guardian, October 31, 2013)", "\u201cI think the public deserves to know,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThe world is better for government being kept under the beady-eyed scrutiny of the media and for salient and interesting facts about public espionage being brought into the public domain.\u201d (The Guardian, October 31, 2013)", "Such views could be seen as part of a broader trend of a \u201cgrowing demand for openness, transparency and accountability\u201d (Murakami Wood and Wright 2015). The emphasis on transparency should also be understood against the backdrop of longer-standing public debates on the secrecy\u2014and resulting power abuses\u2014of the United Kingdom\u2019s intelligence services (e.g. Gill 2012).", "The overarching balance of views taken by sources was one which underwrites the normalization of surveillance in the interest of national security. This was further articulated by the identification of the targets of surveillance. The identification of the targets of surveillance shapes debates over, and public understanding of, what constitutes surveillance and who is surveilled. While over half of references to the targets of surveillance in the first case study, covering the initial Snowden revelations of mass surveillance (56.7 per cent), related to members of the public, this changed over time. Across all five case studies, the most frequently mentioned targets of surveillance were foreign politicians and world leaders, in almost a quarter of cases (24.7 per cent), followed by terrorists (23.5 per cent) and members of the public (22.5 per cent). For instance, the Independent reported on the (apparently widely shared) view of Jan Albrecht, Member of the European Parliament, who characterized the spying on surveillance of embassies as profoundly damaging to international relations, suggesting that: \u201cIt is in clear breach of the principle of co-operation which governs dealings between EU member states. It is not right for European countries to spy on each other\u201d (The Independent, November 5, 2013).", "Coverage thus emphasized the surveillance of political elites and the implications of this surveillance for international relations, as well as the targeted surveillance of suspected terrorists. By contrast, the far more widespread and institutionalized practices of mass surveillance that Snowden was concerned about were less salient. Surveillance was constructed as an issue that is largely relevant to (1) the elite sphere of international politics, and (2) concerns over terrorism and national security. Implications for ordinary people, including distinctions between mass surveillance versus targeted surveillance, were, by contrast, less visible.", "The tendency to report disproportionally on events and actions associated with elites is a long-standing practice in news production, underpinned by news values (Galtung and Ruge 1965; O\u2019Neill and Harcup 2009) and one which clearly informs the universe of available information regarding surveillance. Indeed, as demonstrated in Figure 2, our sample reflects a predominance of political sources\u2014with politicians and their spokespersons appearing the most frequently, at 40.8 per cent of all sources across stories.", "Figure 2  Frequency of source types", "Figure 2  Frequency of source types", "The second-most frequent source type was journalists, accounting for 10.7 per cent of source appearances, while citizens were used as sources in just 5.9 per cent of cases. The opinions of political sources reflect the preoccupations of governments and intelligence agencies, and focus on the implications of the leaks for the sphere of political life. As the primary definers of the story of the Snowden revelations, these perspectives de-emphasize the importance of the revelations for the lives of ordinary citizens.", "Overall, then, our content analysis demonstrates that newspapers\u2014in large part due to the dominance of political sources\u2014contribute to the normalization of surveillance by (1) the more frequent representation of opinion supportive of surveillance in the interest of national security, and viewing the Snowden leaks as damaging to the work of the intelligence services; and (2) identifying political leaders, rather than citizens, as the targets of surveillance."]}, {"title": "Negotiating the Reporting of Surveillance: Journalists\u2019 Discourses", "paragraphs": ["Despite evidence of media coverage contributing to the justification of surveillance, the journalists we interviewed were broadly critical of these practices. They (1) acknowledged the increasing normalization of surveillance, (2) raised concerns about limited public knowledge of surveillance, (3) critiqued media\u2019s contribution to providing justifications for surveillance, and (4) discussed their own experience of surveillance and its potential chilling effects on journalism. Journalists\u2019 views could be viewed as reflective of what Dencik and Cable (forthcoming) have described as \u201csurveillance realism\u201d: the idea that \u201cthe active normalization and justification of mass surveillance in both political and media debate becomes internalized in such a way that it limits the possibilities of imagining a different way of organizing society\u201d. That is to say, just like other citizens, journalists are resigned to, and have internalized, the constant surveillance they experience in everyday life:Well, I\u2019m a resident of the UK and everywhere I go, I\u2019m conscious of being observed by CCTV cameras, for example. So it\u2019s a daily part of one\u2019s existence if you live in the UK.

(John Naughton, Columnist, Observer)", "To several of the journalists, the revelations of the Snowden leaks represented a logical culmination of a slow build-up of surveillance, undermining long-standing divisions between the private and the public (Vincent 2016). These forms of surveillance range from the ubiquitous CCTV cameras to phone bills, and also encompass the phone-hacking scandal which implicated the journalistic profession. At the same time, journalists also stressed the impact of technological change enabling new and more intrusive forms of surveillance:So when the Government talks about we\u2019ve always had access to this data, they are complete ingrates. The data only exists as a result \u2026 of major changes in technology. They try, as Thatcher did with her handbag idea of the economy, to present endearing analogies saying this changes nothing and fail to grasp \u2026 that this is a massive change in the balance of rights and duties between state and citizen.

The vast majority of the journalists we interviewed discussed such experiences. Some even likened their own journalistic work to forms of surveillance:Well, I\u2019ve done a certain amount of it in a sort of amateur way that reporters do, sitting outside people\u2019s houses on a very basic level, doorstepping them and on occasion following them if we\u2019re doing an investigation on something\u2014all within the law.

Several interviewees thought their phones had been tapped. Recalling \u201ca period of time when my phone did not behave properly in terms of clicks and things like that\u201d, the Whitehall Editor for the Sunday Express discussed his suspicions of having his phone tapped:But it\u2019s also occurred to me that for journalists working in this field, and I mean the field of cyber security and to a certain extent, crime and national security, all of us have to really operate on the basis that we are already under quite significant surveillance.

For example, the writers\u2019 interest group PEN has suggested that omnipresent surveillance may cause journalists to self-censor their work and avoid controversial topics (PEN 2013). This, in turn, means that critical and investigative reporting is perceived to be under threat (Rusbridger 2013). Several of our interviewees cited a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on journalism:What worries me \u2026 is police forces \u2026 increasingly getting hold of communications data of journalists.

Skepticism is the proper attitude of journalism but I think it\u2019s probably deepened [and] going towards hostile \u2026 I think the sense that politicians are liars and not to be trusted, that officials obfuscate and cover up, that any authority has to be proven innocent as much as proven guilty, I think has increased in journalism.

This is reflective of a broader set of debates arising after the Snowden revelations which suggest that governments are running roughshod over privacy rights, on the basis of arguments around national security (e.g. Mols and Janssen 2016; Solove 2011). Yet such threats also arise from the growth of social media:It changed quite radically with the internet and mobile phone communications because, first of all, suddenly digital metadata was available, as it were, as a routine part of one\u2019s daily activities. Secondly, because it became increasingly revealing about one\u2019s activities, sometimes one\u2019s views, one\u2019s friends, one\u2019s networks\u2014all that kind of stuff.

Naughton\u2019s statement highlights distinctions between targeted surveillance and mass surveillance, as well as those between metadata and content. Such distinctions were, indeed, highly salient ones to many of our interviewees. Also these distinctions were, to their minds, often glossed over in public debate and in media coverage. At the same time, they also saw emerging forms of surveillance as unfolding within a particular historical context:Most reasonable people would accept you have to have some sort of surveillance, whether that\u2019s police sitting outside someone\u2019s house or bugging a house, and we\u2019ve always been comfortable with those traditional forms [provided] it\u2019s proportionate and it\u2019s necessary.

Despite journalists\u2019 critical views and their concerns about mass surveillance, they were divided on whether the Snowden revelations had been sufficiently comprehensively reported in the media, and shared the conviction that public knowledge of mass surveillance is poor.

As our content analysis has shown, reporting of the Snowden revelations and their aftermath contributed to the normalization of surveillance through an emphasis on national security arguments and the targeted snooping on political elites.", "The structural inhibitions of reporting generate a paradoxical tension between, on the one hand, critical views of surveillance amongst journalists and, on the other hand, their contribution to the normalization of surveillance through their reporting. In particular, we have suggested that journalists\u2019 reliance on elite political sources means that these sources are allowed to frame debates over surveillance.", "Journalism scholars have long grappled with the workings of the \u201cstrategic ritual of objectivity\u201d (Tuchman 1972). The institutional requirement that journalists refrain from stating their own opinions and judgements in their reporting is, on the one hand, central to the authority of journalism as an independent actor in the public sphere. On the other hand, it generates structural limitations to its ability to act as a watchdog on concentrations of power. This is particularly true given the routine reliance on official sources and the \u201cindexing\u201d of reporting to conflict between elites (Bennett 2005). As Ettema and Glasser (1998, 199) observed, \u201cjournalism cannot be more morally engaged than its narrative and rhetorical strategies equip it to be\u201d. What our paper has demonstrated is that it renders journalists incapable of critiquing and calling attention to key social issues of vital importance to the public.
