Her performance set a record for peak Twitter tweets at 306,100 per minute\u2014much more than the 98,300 peak tweets of the previous VMA awards show. Cyrus became the number one most-searched person at Google for 2013, and her twerking performance led to Google's number one \u201cWhat is?\u201d question (Google 2013). With all this visibility, Oxford Dictionaries Online (Datoo 2013) added the term, defined as: \u201cdance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance.\u201d", "This event became so sensationalized that CNN.com topped its website with the story of Miley's twerking, placing it above all other world and national news. That, in turn, led to a fake column on the satirical news website, The Onion, with the CNN.com editor supposedly explaining why this was the top story of the morning for monetary reasons (The Onion 2013, unbylined). The media snowball kept on rolling, as commentary sprung out arguing that The Onion's fake column about the Cyrus scandal had become \u201chyper-real,\u201d more real than the real content of CNN.com. Surprisingly, this hubbub triggered collective memory of yet-another piece from the Onion News Network (ONN), a spoof video from 2008 featuring so-called \u201centertainment scientists\u201d who predicted that at her current performance pace, \u201cMiley Cyrus will be depleted by 2013.\u201d In essence, this hyper-real non-real was used by a variety of media sources to mock-verify assertions by the current satire of CNN.com and lend it greater authority.", "The point of this paper is to demonstrate how \u201cFifth Estate\u201d media largely comprised of bloggers and columnists have the ability\u2014through satire\u2014to hold the Fourth Estate accountable, engaging in boundary work that attempts to relocate journalists back to the central mission of their professional realm (Cohen [2011] 2012; Cooper 2006). It also argues that \u201cfake-news organizations\u201d in their various forms have become part of that growing Fifth Estate.", "After describing the fake Onion column, discussion begins with an overview of \u201cfake news\u201d and the hyper-real, turning next to highlight literature related to boundary work and collective memory. From this vantage point, the paper undertakes a qualitative textual analysis of commentary concerning Miley Cyrus, CNN and The Onion."]}, {"title": "Context of the Study", "paragraphs": ["To better understand the context of this paper's analysis, it will be helpful to first present a brief sketch about Miley Cyrus and her career. A short history of The Onion follows, with these two elements combining to explain the overall scenario of the VMA awards performance.", "Miley Cyrus, the daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, began her singing and acting career at a young age (Wikipedia). Her rise to fame began in 2006 while in her teens with a lead role on the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana. A year later, she debuted a hit music album. Her acting and singing career continued, and by 2013, she had developed a controversial persona emerging from provocative music videos connected to her album Bangerz. This image of Cyrus carried over to her VMA appearance, which incorporated visual images from her videos, including dancing bears, twerking and a frequently extended tongue.", " The Onion is a satirical news agency founded in 1988 in Madison, WI. It began strictly as a print publication, launched its website in 1996, and the online broadcast ONN in 2007. In 2013 it ceased publication of its print edition but continues to publish written and broadcast content online at theonion.com.", "ONN in 2008 ran the story, \u201cEntertainment Scientists Warn Miley Cyrus Will be Depleted by 2013.\u201d The story included a farcical graphic that predicted what could happen to Cyrus, including \u201cIs she too wild?\u201d and \u201cPublic meltdown.\u201d In August 2013, Cyrus created a media firestorm after twerking with pop singer Robin Thicke at MTV's VMAs. The Parents Television Council and media outlets across the globe described the performance as \u201cdisgusting\u201d (Buckland 2013).", "CNN.com made Cyrus\u2019 performance its top website news story for much of the next day. The Onion responded the same day with the parody article, \u201cLet Me Explain Why Miley Cyrus\u2019 VMA Performance Was Our Top Story This Morning.\u201d It was written \u201cfirst person\u201d by a parody version of CNN.com managing editor Meredith Artley, with many online readers believing the real Artley wrote the parody article. She denied her involvement with The Onion's column, issuing a light-hearted Twitter post: \u201cTo clarify, I did not write this \u2026 But I accept all compliments and deny all accusations. Tx for the page views.\u201d"]}, {"title": "Background and Conceptual Foundation", "paragraphs": ["On August 26, 2013\u2014the day after Cyrus\u2019 appearance on MTV's VMAs\u2014CNN.com prominently featured an item comparing Miley Cyrus\u2019 performance to a previously outrageous appearance by Lady Gaga, who had worn a dress made of meat while covered in fake blood. The CNN item explained:While Gaga came equipped with multiple costume- and wig-changes on her side, Cyrus took over the stage with gigantic, dancing bears and more twerking than viewers at home probably knew what to do with.The 20-year- old pop star stepped out onto the stage a ball of energy, wearing a fuzzy gray leotard, as her hit single, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop,\u201d played. An animated and uninhibited performer, Cyrus\u2019 dance moves were a clear departure from her \u201cHannah Montana\u201d days. (Meaning, they involved a crotch grab or two.)The article went on to highlight \u201c6 memorable moments from the VMAs,\u201d raising questions about why \u201cThe Worldwide Leader in News\u201d would feel compelled to display such material so prominently on the CNN.com website against a backdrop of global turmoil. Cyrus\u2019 performance allowed CNN.com to wade into coverage of entertainment news. Comparing Cyrus to Lady Gaga, meanwhile, was a clear case of memory work on the part of CNN, even though Cyrus and Gaga had little in common beyond being famous artists: Gaga's performance was notable for its design; Cyrus\u2019 performance was notable for its sexual overtones. This was not lost on The Onion, which offered a faux-opinion commentary piece the same day, titled \u201cLet Me Explain Why Miley Cyrus\u2019 VMA Performance Was Our Top Story This Morning.\u201d The explanation was simple: an effort to increase Web traffic and boost advertising income:There was nothing, and I mean nothing, about that story that related to the important news of the day, the chronicling of significant human events, or the idea that journalism itself can be a force for positive change in the world \u2026 In fact, putting that story front and center was actually doing, if anything, a disservice to the public. And come to think of it, probably a disservice to the hundreds of thousands of people dying in Syria, those suffering from the current unrest in Egypt, or, hell, even people who just wanted to read about the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech.This satirical example demonstrates the Fifth Estate's role in fake news within a hyper-real context. Although many studies have explored aspects of fake news on Saturday Night Live (SNL), The Daily Show (TDS) and The Colbert Report (TCR), relatively little has been studied regarding The Onion. Fake news succeeds because it parodies traits of real news, including broadcast set pieces and mimicking the tone of \u201creal\u201d hosts found on cable channels such as CNN and Fox News (Borden and Tew 2007). It would be a conceptual error, though, to assume that what has been learned about production and reception of SNL, TDS and TCR can directly be applied to understanding The Onion. There are two key conceptual differences between The Onion and the others.", "While Gaga came equipped with multiple costume- and wig-changes on her side, Cyrus took over the stage with gigantic, dancing bears and more twerking than viewers at home probably knew what to do with.", "The 20-year- old pop star stepped out onto the stage a ball of energy, wearing a fuzzy gray leotard, as her hit single, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop,\u201d played.

In contrast, the presentation of The Onion is nearly anonymous: print news items do not carry a byline and video news reporters are unnamed, unseen or unfamiliar. Fake news exists in different forms. The Onion's ONN has even hired traditional news anchors to read its copy, including one later hired away from ONN by CNN (Sharp 2008).", "Second, social commentary on SNL, TDS and TCR is often steeped in strong exaggeration that signals its comedic intent. As part of the experience, the hosts laugh, grin, and even crack up during their news presentations, making it clear to their audience that their content was intended to appear as fake from the onset. In contrast, The Onion avoids the slapstick and clowning, turning instead to the \u201chyper-real\u201d where both text presentations and on-screen delivery are relatively realistic (Waisanen 2011). Virginia Heffernan, a blogger for The New York Times, described The Onion's video spoofs as \u201cA near-perfect facsimile of a deadly serious cable broadcast\u201d (Heffernan 2008).", "Although in recent years fake news has enjoyed popularity through venues such as SNL, TDS and TCR, fake news owns a far richer history (Barnhurst 2011). Historians have found fake news, satire and parody from the eighth century. Fake news as we conceptually understand it today got its start in the late nineteenth century, a time of rapid growth for newspapers that was aided by emerging technologies (Love 2007). With journalism again in a period of technological revolution, boundaries between \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201creal news\u201d have shifted in both academic and journalistic circles. Fake news is hyper-real because it blurs lines between nonfiction and fiction, which challenges journalistic boundary work when journalistic practices overlap with fake news. The tension has grown from how journalists use fake and real news to challenge the boundaries of what news is and how news is created and with what purpose and effects.", "Fake news bears resemblance to real news thematically. General topics and issues may be the same, such as politics and the economy. Aesthetically, fake-news broadcasts such as TDS and \u201cThe Onion Week in Review\u201d possess the feel of real news programs. But fake news is not bound by the same ethical codes as real news (Borden and Tew 2007). Free from the ethical codes accepted by traditional journalists, purveyors of fake news are free to parody, mock, criticize and fabricate. Fake news does not exist independently of real news. Instead, is exists as a critique of real news, a farcical watchdog that lampoons both journalists and the subjects they cover (Jones and Baym 2010).", "In addition to their role as watchdog, fake-news programs engage young news consumers, a part of the population that was once considered apolitical (Meddaugh 2010). Success of programs such as TCR, which provide news to previously disengaged consumers, has complicated journalism because \u201cfake\u201d news is driving \u201creal\u201d information to media consumers. Also, those who deliver fake news, such as Jon Stewart, are in some instances more trusted than the journalists who deliver real news because consumers perceive Stewart as one who holds \u201creal\u201d journalists accountable (Painter and Hodges 2010).", "The relationship between fake news and media consumers has been addressed by scholars. Less studied is the relationship between fake-news and traditional news organizations. The New York Times in 2010 compared Stewart with legendary broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow (Berkowitz and Gutsche 2012). This acceptance of Stewart by the New York Times and other traditional and newer journalism outlets, such as blogs, stretched the negotiated membership boundaries of journalism (Berkowitz and Gutsche 2012).", "Boundary work allows journalists to decide who is in the group, who is not, ethical expectations, and matters of standards and practice (Gieryn 1999). These boundaries can shift over time as culture and society shift. Traditional news organizations may depict newer forms of media as being outside professional norms, such as when multiple traditional organizations questioned the methods of WikiLeaks (Coddington 2012). Journalists share common understandings of society. Because of this, traditional journalists draw and redraw professional, ethical and ideological boundaries (Carlson and Berkowitz 2012). Journalists, for instance, performed boundary work by publicly discussing the mentality of pack journalism (Frank 2003).", "Traditional journalists create their own professional boundaries, often portraying themselves as officers of the public good (Carlson 2006). Journalists adopt codes of ethics and admonish those who fail to live up to them. Those codes, though, are becoming increasingly difficult to identify, which leaves the door open for fake news to enter the boundaries of journalism as defined by those who practice it (Baym 2005), such as the case with the New York Times and Stewart in the role of Murrow. The term \u201cfake news\u201d is more of a label than a definition. Stewart and Colbert parody the news but also create it when they conduct original interviews or appear on current-affairs shows on traditional cable news networks such as CNN and Fox News Channel. The line between \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201creal news\u201d is further blurred by publications such as The Onion, which creates fake-news stories based on real events while also providing serious content on such cultural issues as sexuality and film and cinema.", "Within hyper-reality, the line between nonfiction and fiction vanishes and what can be considered \u201cauthentic\u201d is delegitimized (Brennen and dela Cerna 2010). Hyper-reality \u201ccalls into question the claims of representation, both cultural and political\u201d (Storey 2012, 196). Recent studies in hyper-reality grew from Eco (1973, 7) and Baudrillard (1994, 1\u201342), who wrote that in the postmodern era reality and simulation operate simultaneously along a single track, without difference. They exist together on a \u201croller-coaster continuum,\u201d a track in which reality bleeds into imagination to produce a new representation of an idea (Storey 2012, 193).", "In March 2014, for instance, US President Barack Obama appeared on the fictional online talk show \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d \u201cFerns\u201d takes on the appearance and form of a cable-access interview show, but the host is a comedian who purposely bumbles his way through segments. Obama engaged in comedic-banter-played-straight with the host but also was given time to promote the Affordable Care Act. Some journalists criticized the president for jeopardizing the dignity of the office by appearing on a fake-news show, but the president said the move allowed him to reach a wider audience (Johnson 2014).", "The hyper-real also occurred in 2008 when two aspiring filmmakers created a fictional political pundit named Martin Eisenstadt, who commented on real and fictional political events. Unable to distinguish simulation from reality, numerous news organizations reported one of Eisenstadt's reports as fact (Perez-Pena 2008). In 2009, Washington Monthly ran an editorial piece praising an upcoming book \u201cwritten\u201d from Eisenstadt's fictional perspective with the acknowledgment that Eisenstadt was a fake. Washington Monthly wrote that the Eisenstadt memoir was \u201cthe best fake news memoir of the campaign season\u201d (Green 2009). Then, in 2012, one of the United States\u2019 most historic cultural magazines, The New Yorker, acquired a fake-news website (Borowitz 2012). This further blurred the line between real news and fake news. The New Yorker links to the fake-news website, \u201cThe Borowitz Report,\u201d from its homepage with no indication that the site is a parody until after readers click on the page.", "If hyper-reality lives in the fake, it follows that \u201creal\u201d news operates in the realm of truth. Truth, of course, can be subjective. Journalists make choices about what information to share, not share, and how to present that information (Deuze 2005). Two key differences between \u201creal\u201d news and \u201cfake\u201d news help segregate the tracks. The first is producer intent. \u201cReal\u201d news reporters, perhaps unaware they are making decisions that will effect audience perception and reveal their biases, operate under the umbrella of journalistic authority and at the very least believes they are reporting the truth (Carlson 2012). \u201cFake\u201d news reporters, such as those who work for The Onion, are aware that they are producing parody. The second difference is audience perception. Audiences hold separate expectations between what they expect from \u201creal\u201d news outlets and \u201cfake\u201d news outlets. When a \u201creal\u201d news organization reveals bias or makes an error, audiences feel outrage. When a \u201cfake\u201d news organization takes sides, it is part of the joke (Becker, Xenos, and Waisanen 2010). The findings of Becker, Xenos, and Waisanen \u201csuggest that viewers draw a measurable and pronounced dividing line between political comedy programs and hard news content\u201d (155).", "In hyper-reality simulation swallows reality. Fake news can become more \u201creal\u201d than real news (Tally 2011). Hyper-reality of journalism reaches even more intense levels when fake news actually predicts future events, such as when The Onion reported Miley Cyrus\u2019 2013 journalism meltdown in 2008 and fictional-pundit Eisenstadt hinted in 2009 at a future political scandal involving New York politician Anthony Weiner (Keefe 2011).", "Hyper-realism can be intentional. Fake-news organizations practice boundary work by creating content with social goals such as creating public dialog (Waisanen 2011). ONN purposively designed its set and journalistic tone to mimic traditional broadcast journalism (Kiss 2008). Said ONN's director: \u201cour goal from the start was to make it look like TV.\u201d", "Fake news, in its hyper-realism, offers social critique in ways that \u201creal news\u201d cannot (Tally 2011), and in that respect becomes more real than real. It has acquired an epistemic authority, the legitimate power to define bounded domains of reality (Gieryn 1999, 1). Whereas mainstream journalism likes to declare itself the watchdog estate, \u201cfake news\u201d puts \u201creal news\u201d into the position of needing to be watched, natural results of parody and satire. Hyper-realization allows fake news to address issues of \u201cgreat civic importance\u201d (Reilly 2012).", "Mainstream journalists use collective memory to re-establish journalistic authority when \u201cfake news\u201d becomes real. Collective memory can help build journalistic authority (Berkowitz 2011). From collective memory springs media memory. Media memory is the journalistic practice of using the media to narrate a collective past (Neiger, Meyers, and Zandberg 2011). Media memory also enables mainstream journalists to practice boundary work, defining what is and is not journalism (Carlson 2006). When ONN's fake-news story accurately predicted the exact year of a Miley Cyrus media meltdown, mainstream journalism acknowledged the fake-news story. It practiced boundary work first by welcoming ONN into the realm of \u201creal\u201d news, then by dismissing ONN through regular reminders to viewers that ONN was a \u201cfake\u201d organization.", "When mainstream news outlets such as MSN.com (Microsoft), The Orlando Sentinel and Gawker Media reported on ONN's fake report, it clarified how hyper-realized fake news has become the Fifth Estate, a network of alternative news sources realized through new technologies and alternative journalistic forms, most notably humor, parody and mimicry (Dutton 2009). The academic term \u201cFifth Estate\u201d has been claimed by such disciplines as journalism, labor studies, criminal studies and organizational theory, among others. In journalism studies the term divides between electronic media, radio broadcasting, watchdog journalism (WikiLeaks, for example), gatekeeping theory and, of course, fake news. The organic nature of blogs, which rely on voluntary interactions rather than structural power, extend blogs into a Fifth Estate role of watching over the Fourth Estate (Cooper 2006). This conceptualization of Fifth Estate should be explicated to also include fake news because of its less formal structure and the organic means through which it attracts audiences. This paper conceptualizes the Fifth Estate as a hybrid of hyper-realized fake news and watchdog journalism as a challenge to the professional boundaries of traditional journalism.", "This leads to four research questions:RQ1: How did the fake-news Fifth Estate engage with other elements of the Fifth Estate (columnists, bloggers) to relocate CNN (and mainstream journalism in general) back within conventional Fourth Estate boundaries?RQ2: How did the notion of hyper-real news shape the authority of the Fifth Estate in the boundary work with CNN.com's VMA coverage?RQ3: How did memory of The Onion's 2008 prediction about the depletion of the Miley Cyrus resource reinforce the authority of its fake CNN editor's column?RQ4: What does this case add to the understanding of professional boundary repair in an age of a rising Fifth Estate?

Of these, 18 were about CNN.com, the Onion and coverage of the VMA broadcast. An additional 11 items related to the 2008 ONN report about depleting Miley Cyrus. Items were considered from the day that the CNN.com story about Cyrus first appeared on August 26, 2013 through late September and early October, when a few follow-up stories appeared. At that point, the stories ceased to appear and no additional items were collected.", "A spreadsheet was built to catalog all the items, which were numbered consecutively to facilitate coordination between the researchers.

First, the discussion addressed the nature of the boundary skirmish. Second, these opinion writers pondered implications for the media as social institution. Third, boundary lines were drawn and redrawn, suggesting which organizations belonged within the boundary of \u201cgood journalism.\u201d", "Early in the conversation among members of this \u201cFifth Estate,\u201d three main concerns were identified through a brief piece from the news organization, Epoch Times (Phillips 2013): (1) the potential monetary gain in the form of \u201cmore clicks\u201d; (2) the notion that nothing was important about the story, so that it did not merit the high visibility it received; and (3) that, ultimately, the VMA story represented a public disservice by a mainstream news organization whose mission was supposedly to serve the public. By pointing to these issues, members of the Fifth Estate were assuming their boundary work, with an effort to bring the mainstream media\u2014particularly CNN.com\u2014back within the Fourth Estate boundary expectations. One of the big questions left dangling asked, \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Two answers surfaced, one pointing at the expectations of a media audience seeking entertainment, one stemming from the basics of maintaining a media business in a highly competitive digital environment.", "For example, a commentary piece by writer Allen Clifton for Forward Progressives brought blame squarely on the audience: \u201ca point I\u2019ve been talking about for years\u2014quality journalism is dying and we\u2019re the ones killing it\u201d (Clifton 2013). Clifton argued that stories like what CNN.com had run about Cyrus\u2019 twerking were simply a response to audience demands:Now I know what some of you are saying, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t read trash stories. I want good news reporting and quality journalism.\u201d Well, if that is true, you\u2019re sadly becoming the exception rather than the rule.

(Clifton 2013)By casting the situation this way, Forward Progressives painted a clear line about the boundaries for quality news organizations and the temptation for some to cross the boundary line for the sake of profit: \u201cSee, consumers are the reason why the media sucks so badly these days,\u201d Clifton concluded. As a bottom line, he argued that CNN.com should not be singled out as going beyond the boundary, because that news organization had simply given the audience what it desired.", "Now I know what some of you are saying, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t read trash stories.

(Clifton 2013)", "This argument was furthered by the news blog site, LA Observed, where writer Kevin Roderick ruminated, \u201cThis may be the best skewer you have ever read of the web strategy that more and more media outlets use\u201d (Roderick 2013). Part of the online media old-guard, Salon, pondered \u201chow and how much cable news ought to be covering Miley Cyrus\u201d (D\u2019Addario 2013). In doing so, the Salon writer attempted to place both CNN and MSNBC outside the \u201cgood journalism\u201d boundary. CNN's Anderson Cooper, for example, opined on air for more than three minutes about the Miley Cyrus flap (while nonetheless showing more clips of the VMA awards program); MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski offered his take on Cyrus\u2019 health condition. Explained Salon writer Daniel D\u2019Addario, with a twist of irony about how Cooper drew attention to the situation while simultaneously urging his audience to ignore it:\u201cIt's all so yawningly formulaic,\u201d said Cooper, just before showing a clip of a four-year-old Cyrus performance in which the singer was said to have pole-danced. Cooper instructed his audience not to pay attention to the VMAs; he, indeed, said he hadn\u2019t watched the show at all. But the Cyrus story is such guaranteed gold that it's worth weighing in on\u2014if only to tell others not to bother being outraged. (D\u2019Addario 2013)Celebrity news website MStarz\u2014an outsider to the institution of journalism\u2014also played up how the hyper-real column in The Onion played a Fifth Estate role:While the entire Internet was buzzing about Miley Cyrus\u2019 VMA performance yesterday, we still expect a little more from our journalistic bastions than we do Twitter, Tumblr and Buzzfeed. That's why it is so surprising that CNN.com ran a twerking recap as their top story (aka the most important thing IN THE WORLD today), a move that got the news organization openly shamed by The Onion. (Galbraith 2013)British political/cultural/current affairs magazine and online website New Statesman took advantage of the situation to accomplish a bit of boundary work with one of its competitors, The Independent. That publication, it turned out, initially took The Onion column as real-real, rather than hyper-real, first publishing that \u201cMeredith Artley, Managing Editor of CNN.com, wrote in The Onion to explain why CNN put Miley as their top story\u201d (Media Mole 2013). Once the error had been pointed out via Twitter, The Independent quickly recast its remark: \u201cA piece in The Onion even joked why CNN put Miley as their top story.\u201d To twist the proverbial knife a little deeper, the New Statesman piece commented on how The Independent had in the past mocked other news outlets for making the exact same kind of mistake.", "\u201cIt's all so yawningly formulaic,\u201d said Cooper, just before showing a clip of a four-year-old Cyrus performance in which the singer was said to have pole-danced.

But the Cyrus story is such guaranteed gold that it's worth weighing in on\u2014if only to tell others not to bother being outraged. (D\u2019Addario 2013)", "While the entire Internet was buzzing about Miley Cyrus\u2019 VMA performance yesterday, we still expect a little more from our journalistic bastions than we do Twitter, Tumblr and Buzzfeed. That's why it is so surprising that CNN.com ran a twerking recap as their top story (aka the most important thing IN THE WORLD today), a move that got the news organization openly shamed by The Onion. (Galbraith 2013)", "In a few cases, Fourth Estate organizations took advantage of the situation to do Fifth Estate-like boundary work. U.S. News writer Robert Schlesinger wrote an opinion piece wherein he first distanced himself from actually paying attention to the VMA program and then stepping in for the kill:Being firmly entrenched in middle age and something of a crank, I didn\u2019t watch the MTV's Video Music Awards \u2026 And yet I know all about Miley Cyrus\u2019 lewd gyrations with singer Robin Thicke. Why is that? Because I have CNN on at my desk all day long, so I got to watch the controversial Miley Cyrus clip yesterday, all day long. (Schlesinger 2013) The Onion's fake column, Schlesinger concluded, \u201chas the virtue of being funny (and, really, not funny) because it's spot-on true.\u201d As much as this Fourth Estate boundary work capitalized on the veracity of hyper-real fake news, another wanna-be member of the Fourth Estate\u2014the entertainment news publication, Variety\u2014donned its Fourth Estate robes to defend the status quo of its boundaries. Editor-in-Chief Andrew Wallenstein argued that The Onion \u201coversimplifies the realities of the digital-news biz,\u201d and therefore, was wrong about the situation (Wallenstein 2013). In a somewhat apologist tone for the media mainstream, Variety offered a boundary-stretching take on those \u201crealities,\u201d one that oddly took advantage of similarities between the words Cyrus and Syria:But were the Onion a real news organization, it might understand a more complicated truth behind the uneasy coexistence of Cyrus and Syria in modern digital newsrooms: It's difficult to subsist on substantive journalism without some help from more crowd-pleasing content. (Wallenstein 2013)Chalking up the CNN decision to play up Cyrus\u2019 VMA performance to, essentially, the cost of doing business in a digital media era, journalists themselves sometimes find themselves \u201c\u2018twerking\u2019 uncomfortably close to the groin of their employer's financial goals\u201d (Wallenstein 2013). From this pragmatic perspective, the piece argued that successful news organizations must strike a balance between audience-driving content and the content that audiences need to know. Continuing with its effort to redraw journalistic boundaries, Wallenstein explained:But that's where those who cherish the Syria coverage need to understand that Cyrus doesn\u2019t detract from Syria; it actually bears the weight of traffic demands that Syria shouldn\u2019t be expected to meet. Thus Cyrus is helping shoulder the cost of more substantial coverage that Syria can\u2019t possibly meet on its own.Still forgetting that The Onion is a fake-news organization, the hyper-real nature of its CNN parody kept Wallenstein moving the argument farther ahead, likening news of the Cyrus ilk to the function of a circus barker:Syria can even benefit from a little Cyrus time; there's something to be said for any kind of content triggering a mass influx of users, which increases the chance they will move on to other content on the site. Come for Cyrus, stay for Syria. (Wallenstein 2013)Dangling Variety's unreal explanation of the hyper-real Onion column, though, caught some push-back from its attempt to claim turf within mainstream journalism's boundaries. Peter Bella, a writer on the Chicago Tribune's blog site Chicago Now responded the next day with a take-off of Variety's piece, \u201cWhy the Onion is Wrong About CNN and Miley Cyrus.\u201d The similarly titled \u201cVariety is Wrong About The Onion and Miley Cyrus\u201d made a blunt attempt to re-locate Variety outside the boundaries of the journalistic mainstream with the battle cry, \u201cthe editors and so-called reporters at Variety have too much time on their hands and no sense of humor\u201d (Bella 2014). Claiming that Variety subsists on content from \u201centertainment public relations weasels and ferrets,\u201d Bella condoned its more-or-less unauthorized effort at boundary work:Variety goes even deeper into the miasma when they attempt to explain quality journalism. That is laughable. The Onion should do a humor hit piece of the alleged \u201cquality journalism\u201d Variety claims they produce. Maybe because they are in Hollywood they can get away with calling their drek \u201cjournalism.\u201d (Bella 2014)The real reason that Variety ran its take on quality journalism, he claimed, was to undertake its own boundary work to keep mainstream journalism outside the boundaries of entertainment journalism. \u201cThe only reason Variety ran this piece was to assuage the weasels and ferrets retained by entertainers and studios\u201d (Bella 2014).", "Being firmly entrenched in middle age and something of a crank, I didn\u2019t watch the MTV's Video Music Awards \u2026 And yet I know all about Miley Cyrus\u2019 lewd gyrations with singer Robin Thicke.

(Yu 2013)The previous week, news-blog PandoDaily went to Cyrus herself through some outtakes published by the not-quite-Fourth Estate magazine Rolling Stone. PandoDaily reporter Hamish McKenzie re-connected back to the Onion's column to express the kind of \u201cmedia outrage\u201d such as what came in response to the CNN coverage of the VMA program.

(McKenzie 2013)In all, this discussion began with the premise that The Onion's fake column by CNN.com editor Meredith Artley\u2014and the controversy surrounding it\u2014represented Fifth Estate boundary work to readjust the appropriate roles for mainstream news organizations. In CNN.com's case, it had featured salacious click-bait about Cyrus\u2019 VMA twerking performance while temporarily downplaying national and world news of the day. The Onion's column had touched a tender spot in mainstream journalism's flesh that really deployed a critique of CNN's decision as synecdoche for the economic imperatives facing mainstream journalism as a whole, with its hyper-real presentation lending authority and credibility to its Fifth Estate critique.", "The Cyrus/CNN story\u2014a real-time take on the news of the moment that rapidly became an Internet meme\u2014encapsulates The Onion's aggressive shift from weekly humor newspaper to 24/7 digital satirist, all the while clinging tightly to its image as the righteous spitball thrower of the American media.

In doing so, mainstream organizations and bloggers presented fake-news organizations in two ways. First, mainstream news organizations presented The Onion as more than a novelty act that just happened to accurately predict the coming of \u201creal\u201d news. Via the accuracy of The Onion's 2008 Cyrus article, mainstream news organizations and Fifth Estate bloggers bestowed authority upon The Onion that those same mainstream organizations and bloggers then used as a device to employ media memory in its representation of Cyrus\u2019 VMA performance.", "Additionally, mainstream news organizations described The Onion with amazement and admiration. In these instances, mainstream tone focused more on the audacity of Cyrus\u2019 performance and less on the reputation and representation of The Onion. In both types of description\u2014memory device and amazement\u2014mainstream news organizations deployed media memory to sell their Cyrus narratives.", " The Onion's original 2008 article gave Fifth Estate bloggers the connector they needed to invoke other instances of \u201cshocking\u201d celebrity actions. This memory work was evident in numerous pieces, including one in Neon Tommy, a popular blog run by students at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. In the post, Neon Tommy assumed its readers were familiar with The Onion. Nowhere did it describe The Onion as a fake-news organization.", "The blog wrote that The Onion was \u201cspot on\u201d in its 2008 segment. Then the author invoked the names of troubled celebrities in an attempt to put Cyrus\u2019 actions into context:She [Cyrus] is turning into a Britney Spears or a Lindsay Lohan because it seems as she is just off her rocker. She could end up in a situation like Amanda Bynes, where she starts lashing out at anyone and everyone and makes remarks towards them that just don\u2019t make sense. (Gomez 2013) Neon Tommy provided no context for Spears, Lohan and Bynes. Their names alone were the context. In reality, the three celebrities noted by Neon Tommy had little in common with Cyrus. Spears struggled with personal problems and was hospitalized (Singer 2007). Lohan and Bynes have each faced legal troubles (Carter 2010; Kaufman 2013). Cyrus, as of this analysis, has not dealt with any of the issues faced by the three celebrities invoked by Neon Tommy. But the blog nonetheless used The Onion's 2008 article as the vessel for introducing Spears, Lohan and Bynes into the narrative. The Onion's validated fake news gave it authority that was then used by Neon Tommy to provide context that may or may not have been accurate.", "She [Cyrus] is turning into a Britney Spears or a Lindsay Lohan because it seems as she is just off her rocker. She could end up in a situation like Amanda Bynes, where she starts lashing out at anyone and everyone and makes remarks towards them that just don\u2019t make sense. (Gomez 2013)", "The Neon Tommy sample echoed a post in The Memphis Flyer, which acknowledged its lack of understanding of Cyrus\u2019 career, but it still invoked the names of other celebrities to contextualize Cyrus\u2019 actions:I do not know if Miley Cyrus is just the latest in the entertainment media's production line of soon-to-be-burnt-out, drug-addled young music/screen stars, a la Lohan, Spears, Bynes, [Justin] Bieber, [Amy] Winehouse, etc., or whether she is skillfully, soberly, and purposefully being outrageous to enhance her career, al la Lady Gaga and Madonna before her. (Vanwyngarden 2013) The Memphis Flyer went on to write that The Onion in 2008 \u201cgot the Miley Cyrus story exactly right.\u201d The Onion story was the impetus behind the post. Without The Onion's 2008 predictive article, The Memphis Flyer would not have been able to compose its post that employed media memory even more extensively. Neon Tommy stopped at Spears, Lohan and Bynes, but The Memphis Flyer introduced Winehouse, a pop singer who died from drug overdose, to contextualize Cyrus. It also invoked the memories of Lady Gaga and Madonna to consider whether Cyrus might not be a tragic celebrity at all, but instead a shrewd businesswoman.", "I do not know if Miley Cyrus is just the latest in the entertainment media's production line of soon-to-be-burnt-out, drug-addled young music/screen stars, a la Lohan, Spears, Bynes, [Justin] Bieber, [Amy] Winehouse, etc., or whether she is skillfully, soberly, and purposefully being outrageous to enhance her career, al la Lady Gaga and Madonna before her. (Vanwyngarden 2013)", " Neon Tommy and The Memphis Flyer are obscure next to Gawker.com, a mammoth Fifth Estate journalistic watchdog organization with hundreds of millions of page views (Bercovici 2014). Gawker, too, used The Onion's predictive article to generate new content. Gawker declared \u201cat least we\u2019ll always have The Onion\u201d in its August 2013 post about The Onion's 2008 article predicting Cyrus\u2019 media meltdown (Zimmerman 2013). The article opened with a bit of memory work, hyperlinking to a website that described The Onion's editorial history. By establishing in the lead The Onion's history of fudging its corporate timeline, Gawker was able to also establish, via humor, that The Onion's ability to bend time had precedent:there is good reason to believe The Onion may actually be from the future. How else would one explain its eerie ability to accurately predict future events? Case in point: Miley Cyrus. (Zimmerman 2013) Gawker went on to use a mystical term, writing that The Onion \u201cprophesied\u201d Cyrus\u2019 VMA performance five years before it happened. It concluded by paraphrasing the original article from The Onion, sharing with readers access to the information which led to Gawker's post.", "there is good reason to believe The Onion may actually be from the future. How else would one explain its eerie ability to accurately predict future events? Case in point: Miley Cyrus. (Zimmerman 2013)", "Memory work was also performed by Huffington Post. Similar to Neon Tommy, Huffington Post provided no context for its readers for what The Onion was. Huffington Post allowed The Onion as a standalone entity to create its own authority through meaning.

(Luippold 2013)Because of its 2008 article on Cyrus, The Onion was described by mainstream media as a prophet. It was called prescient and eerie. It was praised for its mere existence and built into a journalistic authority figure that then allowed members of the Fifth Estate to institute media memory that, ironically, may have portrayed Cyrus inaccurately. The fake-news organization got it right, which afforded legitimate news organizations the ability to get it wrong.

(Luippold 2013)", "In all, The Onion gained journalistic authority through the memory work of Gawker, Huffington Post, Neon Tommy and The Memphis Flyer. Each added authority to The Onion in its own way: Gawker cited The Onion's history and predictive capabilities; Huffington Post praised The Onion for its accuracy; Neon Tommy used The Onion's 2008 Cyrus article as the foundation of its contemporary Cyrus coverage; and The Memphis Flyer, which also used The Onion as foundational work, highlighted The Onion's accuracy while giving readers no indication that The Onion is a fake-news organization."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["This study began with the premise that bloggers, columnists and even fake-news organizations have come to serve as a Fifth Estate watching over the mainstream journalism institution. This Fifth Estate engages in boundary work attempting to bring journalists back to the practices of their professional realm.", "In recent years, fake-news purveyors have gained traction as part of the new Fifth Estate. Although broadcast satirists such as Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and SNL's Weekend Update cast members have taken on that role, the hyper-real nature of The Onion and ONN has gained some extra credibility by following journalism forms of mainstream media while also offering a satirical view that avoids the obvious gestures of their joker-in-arms comrades. That was certainly the case when The Onion's fake column supposedly by CNN.com editor Meredith Artley drew widespread attention to the appropriate boundaries for mainstream media organizations. This authority was shored up ironically through memory of ONN's report about the depletion of the Miley Cyrus resource by 2013, the year the VMA program was broadcast.", "Through textual analysis of blogs and columns, this paper explored four research questions. The first question asked how fake news\u2014The Onion in particular\u2014interacted with other elements of the Fifth Estate to bring CNN.com back to within its professional boundaries. In this situation, bloggers over and over again began by accepting The Onion's critique as accurate and then focused on why CNN.com chose to highlight Cyrus\u2019 twerking performance in terms of Fourth Estate norms. Part of the blame was placed on the audience and its interests; other blame pointed to the necessities of doing business in a digital media environment. Lurking below the surface of this critique was the synecdoche of CNN.com representing a larger swath of the struggling media institution.", "A second question asked about the effect of The Onion's hyper-real approach to satire. As the analysis suggested, by avoiding the mixture of clowning-and-critique found with other fake-news sources, The Onion avoided ambiguity in its message that added authority, and even believability. A third question asked about the effect of ONN's 2008 prediction of a five-year depletion of the Miley resource. This provided a tongue-in-cheek double authority for the CNN.com column that reaffirmed the accuracy of The Onion's vision of society. A final question asked about what this case study can add to the understanding of professional boundary work. What stands out most clearly is how the growing Fifth Estate has begun taking on a vital role in watching the watchers as the mainstream media continue to strike a balance between making a profit in a new media economy and providing news that serves society.", "In all, this study helps to clarify the distinction between two related concepts: paradigm repair and boundary work. In its traditional application, the notion of paradigm repair implies an effort to re-instill confidence in the unwritten rules of professional practice. It is a process adopted by those who base their work on a paradigm incorporating aspects such as truth, impartiality, confidentiality and honesty along with a set of practices designed to assure those aspirations are attained. Boundary work, in contrast, can be undertaken by both those within the Fourth Estate who adjust and adapt to changes and pressures in the media environment, as well as those outside the Fourth Estate who attempt to stake out an area of journalistic turf where they can play a valuable role, whether for their own gain or for the betterment of society.", "But the processes of boundary work and paradigm repair have begun to blur between the mainstream media and the Fifth Estate media that are more-or-less watching the watchers. This suggests that as mainstream media organizations face increasing economic pressures to ensure their survival, the temptation grows to cross traditional professional boundaries. Because most mainstream organizations face this same dilemma, they become less likely to cast the first stone and criticize their peers. This is where the Fifth Estate gains its foothold in society by increasing credibility while not being held to traditional Fourth Estate standards. In this way, members of the Fifth Estate become surrogates for the work that the Fourth Estate sees as increasingly dangerous to undertake on its own."]}], "references": [{"title": "The New \u2018Media Affect\u2019 and the Crisis of Representation for Political Communication", "year": "2011", "journal": "The International Journal of Press/Politics", "volume": "16", "authors": [{"name": "Barnhurst Kevin G.", "first_name": "Barnhurst", "last_name": "G."}]}, {"title": "The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism", "year": "2005", "journal": "Political Communication", "volume": "22", "authors": [{"name": "Baym Geoffrey", "first_name": "Baym", "last_name": "Geoffrey"}]}, {"title": "Sizing up the Daily Show: Audience Perceptions of Political Comedy Programming", "year": "2010", "journal": "Atlantic Journal of Communication", "volume": "18", "authors": [{"name": "Becker Amy B.", "first_name": "Becker", "last_name": "B."}, {"name": "Xenos Michael A.", "first_name": "Xenos", "last_name": "A."}, {"name": "Waisanen Don J.", "first_name": "Waisanen", "last_name": "J."}]}, {"title": "Variety Is Wrong about The Onion and Miley Cyrus", "year": "2014", "journal": "", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Bella Peter", "first_name": "Bella", "last_name": "Peter"}]}, {"title": "The Playboy Interview: A Candid Conversation with Gawker&#039;s Nick Denton", "year": "2014", "journal": "Playboysfw.com", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Bercovici Jeff", "first_name": "Bercovici", "last_name": "Jeff"}]}, {"title": "Drawing Lines in the Journalistic Sand: Jon Stewart, Edward R.
