It is often claimed that women have little interest in pornography and the lack of success of these top-shelf titles appears to support those claims. Yet this tells us very little about the commercial and professional decisions to target female readers, nor does it tell us anything about the publishers\u2019 attempts to provide a sufficiently female experience of heterosexual sex that would persuade women to forget their \u201cinnate\u201d distaste for explicit representations. Drawing on interviews with editorial staff, this paper explores the production and development of For Women magazine alongside the editorial team's efforts to reconcile the contents of the magazine with the shifting concerns of potential advertisers, stockists and readers.

This paper is a small contribution focusing on one area of porn publishing that has suffered from a double neglect\u2014pornography for women is generally held to be a mythical creature.

The \u201cpornographication\u201d (McNair, 2002) of culture has also seen the expansion of men's magazine publishing and the proliferation of soft-core imagery in mainstream magazines like Loaded, Nuts and Zoo. These mainstream \u201cporno-lite\u201d men's publications have grown even as the profit has fallen out of the top-shelf market. The four major legal players in Britain:1 Galaxy,2 Paul Raymond Group,3 David Sullivan/Gold Brothers4 and Northern & Shell (N & S),5 have had to contend with falling sales, increasing competition from other formats including new technologies and mainstream men's publishing and the attendant loss of advertising revenue.6 Top-shelf publishing has remained something of a cartel (O'Toole, 1998),7 hidebound by interpretations of the Obscene Publications Act, distributor guidelines and an unwillingness to test the boundaries of public morality and reader expectations. Thus, from the late 1980s, the top-shelf market has been characterized by decline and relative stagnation making the move into other market sectors necessary in order to maintain profits (Smith, 2005). N & S was, perhaps, the most willing to attempt new market sectors\u2014in 2000, only 10 per cent of the company's profits derived from pornography (Teather and Burkeman, 2000) and the company now owns Express Newspapers. In the 1990s, alongside the production of more mainstream and \u201crespectable\u201d publications like OK! and Sindy magazine, N & S looked to expand their customer base by producing magazines for gay men (Attitude) and \u201csexually-liberated\u201d women."]}, {"title": "The Launch of For Women Magazine", "paragraphs": ["N & S's top-shelf division Portland Publishing launched For Women (Figure 1) in 1992 to a fanfare of free publicity\u2014newspapers, TV and radio journalists all falling over themselves to pronounce upon this latest offering from the stable of the \u201cpeople's pornographer\u201d, Richard Desmond. Originally conceived as a one-off Penthouse For Women, the magazine featured all the staples of a woman's title\u2014problem page, celeb interviews, fashion, gossip and sex advice alongside erotic stories and nude men. To the aggressively forward thinking N & S the time seemed right to enter the mainstream women's market but to do so with a title which would utilize its many years\u2019 experience in soft-core publishing. The company was not alone in investigating the possibilities of sexually explicit titles for women. Two other titles\u2014Bite and Ludus\u2014joined the already existing Playgirl. The popular soft-core letters magazine, Forum, had a female readership of 40 per cent and mainstream popular culture seemed to provide overwhelming evidence that women wanted sexual representations specifically geared to them.", "Figure 1.\u2003 Image by kind permission of For Women and Portland Publishing", "Figure 1.\u2003 Image by kind permission of For Women and Portland Publishing", "The underwhelming success of 1970s\u2019 magazines Playgirl and Viva has been used as evidence that a mass-produced pornography for women is doomed to failure8 but in spite of that lack of success for an expressly titled \u201cpornography for women\u201d, women's access to sexually explicit materials had begun to rise by the end of the 1980s. A range of confessional and novel formats had appeared (the collections of women's fantasies such as My Secret Garden by Nancy Friday and \u201cshopping and fucking\u201d novels\u2014from Conran's Lace to Burchill's Ambition). Even Mills & Boon had begun to feature sex. Newspaper reports suggested that the increasingly popular Anne Summers parties and rocketing sales of \u201csaucy\u201d and sexy underwear were evidence that women were embracing a more aggressive and visible female sexuality. Early 1980s\u2019 advertising images of men's bodies had begun a process of education of consumers to see men's bodies as sexually appealing (Carter, 1987, p. 111). Developments in popular culture were beginning to legitimize the idea of a \u201cporn for women\u201d\u2014what Juffer labels \u201cdomesticated pornography\u201d, that is, sexually explicit materials which have been \u201ctamed\u201d of their specifically \u201cmale\u201d elements in order \u201cto carve out spaces for its consumption and for fantasy within\u2009\u2026\u2009daily routines\u201d (1998, p. 5). It is in the context of these different media phenomena that For Women (FW) and its rivals emerge. To the publishers women appeared ripe for exploitation as a new market. As Zak Jane Keir, a member of the launch team, explained: The social climate had seemed to be changing for a year or so before we started: it was the time of huge publicity and popularity for the Dreamboys and the Chippendales\u2014although the whole \u201cladette\u201d thing was another two or three years off.9   ", "The social climate had seemed to be changing for a year or so before we started: it was the time of huge publicity and popularity for the Dreamboys and the Chippendales\u2014although the whole \u201cladette\u201d thing was another two or three years off.9 ", "Jonathan Richards claimed a conversation at a dinner party had convinced him that women wanted more than Cosmo, \u201cI look at Cosmo and it promises everything and then fails to deliver\u201d (interview, 13 January 1994). The most significant factor for N & S was the increasingly sexual content in mainstream women's magazines. By the early 1990s editors had, as Braithwaite observed, thrown caution to the wind, \u201cNo sexual holds have been barred, no byway unexplored\u201d (1995, p. 157). Certainly there appeared to be a change in the ways in which magazines talked about sex. It was no longer enough to answer women's questions about sexual matters; magazines seemed ready to celebrate sexual activity outside the narrow perimeters of \u201cprocreative sex\u201d. Groups like the Social Affairs Unit regarded the state of women's magazines as an indication of the progressive decline in standards of morality. Magazines like Company, Cosmopolitan and Elle supposedly fostered in women individualist pursuit of aggressive sexual pleasures and material indulgences to the exclusion of responsibilities and care for others. The magazines hit back at their critics by focusing on the \u201cinformation\u201d they offered and the ways in which the changing sexual climate and sexually transmitted diseases, demanded frank discussion.", "The argument failed to convince industry and academic commentators; it was simply a \u201ccynical camouflage\u201d of sex which boosted circulation without a care for the effects on women and girls. However, as Gough-Yates has suggested, this has \u201cfailed to contextualise the issue of sexual content in women's magazines within shifts in the moral cultures of contemporary Britain and in relation to broader debates about morality, femininity, youth and media regulation\u201d (2000, p. 230). Her argument is persuasive.", "Shifts across a range of publishing, legislative and cultural sites made the possibility of sexually explicit publications for women more attractive to publishers. Attractive does not simply mean that a target audience had been identified as ready for the publication, publishers (especially those given the title pornographer) prefer to carry on their business without intervention from the state or arousing too much controversy from moral groups. Therefore, it is not simply that a profitable group of women seemed ready for sexually explicit publications but that wider culture appeared accommodating.", "But the market for female erotica was, and still is, in its infancy. Despite Cosmo's increasingly sexual content there was never any overt intention to sexually arouse the reader. Its articles and features were about the cerebral aspects of sexual activity or the acquisition of techniques rather than the possibilities of fantasy and actual bodily activity. This distinction is crucial, not just because it means that the \u201cpleasure zone\u201d of Cosmo was sufficiently disguised that it avoided real censure from watchdogs but also because there may be less expectation of a magazine which analyses rather than attempts to produce sexual feeling. FW began with few market precedents to draw on and its editorial team had to feel its way around \u201cfemale sexuality\u201d and what might be possible; this required a responsiveness that erred on the side of caution. Such caution does not make for a confident editorial stance and FW was only ever briefly confident of its message and its appeal.", "The production of FW actually stands out as anomalous in N & S's operations. Within the company's portfolio, specialization and \u201cnarrow casting\u201d has led to the paring down of magazines to minimal editorial and lots of pictures\u2014often recycled and used in sister publications. Magazines are laid out on Apple Mac with minimal editorial input and a spread of personnel across as many as four titles. Although produced by a very small team (especially by Cosmo standards), FW was launched with a variety of expensive editorial elements and intentions to breach the mainstream. The cover line \u201cWhat they don't show you in Cosmo!\u201d was designed to do a lot of work! It was, first and foremost, a \u201cplacing of tanks on Cosmo's lawns\u201d, FW intended to usurp Cosmo's crown as the most s-explicit of women's magazines. It was to be more than just a sex magazine: by drawing on the already existing and well-known persona of Cosmopolitan, the tone was set."]}, {"title": "A Brief History of For Women ", "paragraphs": ["Portland launched three magazines, For Women, Women Only and Women on Top,10 a superabundance to ensure that all sections of the female erotic market were covered and to safeguard FW from the challenge of rival publications. Although a standard procedure when entering a new market it can also be seen as an acknowledgement of wavering confidence in their ability to meet the needs of female consumers. The nude male pin-ups saw Portland's titles confined to the top shelf while Bite (Gold Publishing's Anne Summers magazine), which concentrated on articles and features and no photo-sets, was able to take a place amongst the middle-shelf mainstream women's publications.11 This banishment effectively meant that FW's challenge to Cosmopolitan was empty: the top-shelf is traditionally a no-go zone for women.", "Staff from Penthouse and Forum put together the first issue. There were disagreements: many about the nature and function of a female erotic magazine. Keir told me that What went into the magazine was arrived at by putting questions to as many women as we could get our hands on and distilling their answers (or, as I seem to recall, ignoring the ones that some people didn't think were normal or appropriate). All other decisions were arrived at depending on what was available, affordable and didn't have us rowing with each other too vigorously. For Keir, not all writings about female sexuality were in women's interests. The difficulties of addressing women's sexual needs did not go away but the team felt that they were doing something significant and that the magazine was more than \u201cjust another product\u201d. Some members had a radical, perhaps even evangelical, approach to the magazine\u2014at the very least it would challenge any lingering remnants of sexual repression.

Taking seriously its straddling of two genres, the woman's and the soft-core magazine, FW was to be a heady mix of froth and provocation that your mother wouldn't like. Richards intended it to \u201cbreak the tyranny of the top-shelf\u201d (interview with the author) and Koprowski thought \u201cit [would] meet\u2009\u2026\u2009the needs of modern women\u2009\u2026\u2009they want full nudity and feel cheated without it\u201d (quoted in Sullivan, 1992). Unfortunately even within the editorial team, too much was expected of the magazine. While some in Portland placed profit above politics, Keir, deputy launch editor, hoped for better things: I did have a political viewpoint at that time (still do). I was very sure that sexual pleasure for women, sexual freedom for women, mattered a lot (and wasn't based on buying the right lipstick).

I was very sure that sexual pleasure for women, sexual freedom for women, mattered a lot (and wasn't based on buying the right lipstick). (interview with the author)", "These expectations were linked to the delineation of FW as different from other publications in N & S's portfolio\u2014a woman's magazine was seen to offer the possibility of opening up, of accessing, a level of discussion and exploration of sexuality which might lead to change. FW was oriented to the future possibilities of sexual freedom (those aspirations were to be severely tested by readers and critics). That FW had a difficult juggling task is evident: advertisers stayed away, after an initial high, sales dropped, costs were cut, affecting content and leading to further drops in sales. Had the magazine been published by anyone other than N & S it is almost certain to have been closed. The failure to keep women's interests was reflected in a further loss of managerial confidence. Until mid-1995 FW operated with relative autonomy and a limited budget. After that, it was beleaguered: its content seemed less assured and parts of the magazine were being dropped because they were expensive. A number of disastrous direction changes were made, dictated by N & S's Advertising Department.", "From launch FW had failed to draw in major advertisers and had relied on bulk purchases\u2014a flat rate paid for inclusion in six N & S publications. This posed a real dilemma for the magazine, some advertisers were entirely unsuitable for a woman's magazine (especially those for telephone sex-lines), but their money was absolutely vital to the continuance of the publication. Mainstream advertisers were unconvinced of the magazine's ability to deliver substantial numbers of target women, and they hated the possibility of their glossy ad being placed next to male genitalia. To appeal to them, the Advertising Department insisted on a cover-up of the male nude photosets.", "The folly of this was blindingly apparent to then editor Ruth Corbett: in a magazine which claims its USP is the courage to show what is not on show anywhere else it was suicide to dispense with the genitals. The six-month trial precipitated a real decline in sales: to add insult to injury the magazine was not moved from the top to middle shelves in newsagents (as had been hoped) and advertisers stayed away. The \u201cWillies are back!\u201d edition appeared in January 1996 but there was a price: a 10 per cent reduction in content. This was the first of many setbacks: an attempt to relaunch with a lower cover price and the injection of more humour in late 1996 also failed to halt the downward trend. WH Smith removed the magazine from its stores to make way for more profitable sandwiches. The slide continued. FW struggled on in reduced circumstances and with a budget of \u00a32500 per issue and a shared editorial team of three until earlier this year.", "We could of course simply claim that that history indicates women's porn is doomed to failure but I think it is more complex than simply the publishers getting it wrong. A fuller analysis of FW must examine its distribution/circulation as a \u201cwoman's pornography\u201d, \u201ca good read\u201d and as an object of classification. Moreover, it must acknowledge the ways in which FW must participate in dialogue, not just with its readers, but with the range of \u201cclassifiers\u201d\u2014reviewers and critics\u2014the cultural \u201cauthorities\u201d whose interpretations and evaluations of the magazine appeared in the press. And the constraining demands of distributors and stockists. FW drew on certain aspects of feminism's claims to equality for women: equality was a central theme of the editorial right from the launch issue\u2014if men can look, so can women; if men can be aroused by sexually explicit materials, so can women. The utilization of female emancipation in order to sell magazines may be characterized as little more than advertising-speak, nevertheless it is part of the meanings that circulate the magazine and, as such, formed part of its reception. It also provided a benchmark by which its commentators and detractors could measure the magazine. The whole idea of the magazine is alien to the female psyche. You simply cannot role reverse the centrefold concept, put it on the news-stands and expect women to buy it.  (Jessica Davies, Daily Mail, 5 May 1992)  ", "The whole idea of the magazine is alien to the female psyche. You simply cannot role reverse the centrefold concept, put it on the news-stands and expect women to buy it. ", "(Jessica Davies, Daily Mail, 5 May 1992)", "The problem for many commentators seemed to lie in the overt commercialization of the role reversal; it was the possible profitability of sexually explicit materials that detracted from their possibilities as \u201cauthentically\u201d woman-led or offering a measure of transgression.12 Therefore, for these critics, the appearance of naked or near naked men (whether for women or men) cannot be understood as offering oppositional or taboo-breaking identities for the viewer as their display is always at the service of capitalism and its profiteers (Figure 2). These ideas featured in the populist discourses of newspapers and other media but come from feminist theorization and Marxist analysis.", "Figure 2.\u2003 Image by kind permission of For Women and Portland Publishing", "Figure 2.\u2003 Image by kind permission of For Women and Portland Publishing", "The most significant deployment of language in the newspaper columns was the refusal to name what it was that FW was doing. In almost every account coy euphemisms were used for the supposed defining feature of the magazine\u2014its full-frontal nude males\u2014and for the responses those were designed to elicit. In fact, the dispute could be understood as centring on what could not be spoken rather than what was. The penis remained cloaked in mystery; masturbation remained the secret possibility and sexual activity, from mutual ecstasy to violent rape, the unspoken. In the \u201cdisputes\u201d over FW's right to claim that it offers a truly female pornography, we see social dialogue in action: the back and forth over whether or not women could be turned on by a magazine is an illustration of the conflict over what will count as authentically female sexuality and, drawing on the ideas of Bourdieu (1984 [1979]), a matter of taste.", "Unfortunately for the production team, taste was to be a defining and ultimately severe constraint. From the outset, the team had to submit pre-production proofs to Menzies and WH Smith. The vetting procedures of these two companies ensured that the magazine could never really fulfil its promise to show more than Cosmo. The \u201cangle of the dangle\u201d or the censoring of erections is often thought to be enshrined in the Obscene Publications Act, in fact it is not explicitly forbidden, but that is precisely the position taken by the distributors. I am not claiming that erections guarantee an erotic experience but the magazine had an intention to speak to, and for, women with a \u201ccertain attitude\u201d to sex. The appeal was to like-minded women, a popular call to appreciate the values of the magazine that serves to mask a very complexly constituted audience of women. This can be seen as wishful thinking on the part of the editorial team\u2014while acknowledging that women are not an homogenous group, they clearly hoped to appeal to a \u201cstate of mind\u201d which recognized female sexuality as a source of possibilities to be addressed via articles, letters, fiction, photographs and general editorial. Part of that state of mind was, I found in interviews with readers, an ability to speak openly, honestly and explicitly about sexual matters\u2014the erections or, more precisely, the lack of them spoke volumes about the magazine's limitations. (see Smith, 2007).", "Its textual elements spoke to a female identity: an identity made possible by feminist activism and debates about the social and cultural construction of women and sexuality and influenced by the political and theoretical challenges of the 1980s to the previous decade's feminist politics.13 The \u201cwoman\u201d envisaged by FW could be described as \u201cpost-feminist\u201d in that she has moved beyond \u201cthe impulses and images\u201d of early feminism and is \u201cpermissive and even enthusiastic about consumption\u201d (Brunsdon, 2000, p. 291). FW was not attempting a political definition of a particular collective identity, nor was it a backlash against the gains of feminist activism. Rather, being a woman is expressed in the magazine as a range of desires and expectations. Those expectations and the failure to meet them adequately became yet another stumbling block. While the editorial team understood the importance of exposure to their right to claim they showed more than Cosmo, advertisers, distributors and newsagents saw this as the step too far. Traditional accounts of women's magazines and of pornography stress the collusion of editorial staff in the promotion of limited and/or false ideas about women and their lives. While an editor will surely stamp her own authority on a magazine, we must also acknowledge the constraining factors that influence her decisions. Gough-Yates has suggested that editors must be adept at the complex juggling of the different interests of readers, advertisers, distributors and owners\u2014perhaps FW's problem was that there were just too many balls."]}], "references": [{"title": "\u201cThe Look of Love\u201d", "year": "1987", "journal": "Australian Journal of Cultural Studies", "volume": "3", "authors": [{"name": "carter mick", "first_name": "carter", "last_name": "mick"}]}, {"title": "\u201cEqual Time for Women: social notes on the male strip show\u2019", "year": "1982", "journal": "Urban Life", "volume": "11", "authors": [{"name": "peterson david", "first_name": "peterson", "last_name": "david"}, {"name": "dressel paula l.", "first_name": "dressel", "last_name": "l."}]}, {"title": "\u201cWho Makes the Profit?\u201d", "year": "1996", "journal": "Independent on Sunday", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "spillus alex", "first_name": "spillus", "last_name": "alex"}]}, {"title": "\u201cMore Sex With Your Beefcake\u201d", "year": "1992", "journal": "The Times", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "sullivan caroline", "first_name": "sullivan", "last_name": "caroline"}]}, {"title": "", "year": "2000", "journal": "The Guardian", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "teather david", "first_name": "teather", "last_name": "david"}, {"name": "burkeman oliver", "first_name": "burkeman", "last_name": "oliver"}]}]}
