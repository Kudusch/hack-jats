By adopting a combined methodological perspective: between an ethnographic approach to journalism augmented with Membership Categorisation Analysis (MCA), we consider in detail the preparation for the debate by the journalists behind the scenes as they raise and negotiate journalist ethics in relation to inventing an audience member to ask a question during the debate. Our analysis highlights how and why an \u201cideal\u201d intervention (all the debaters agree the relevance of the question) is balanced against the journalism apparent ethics in using fictitious identities in the name of public interest.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In this paper, we explore the intersection of journalism ethics in the face of professional day to day practice, where professional reasoning is deployed to justify deliberately breaching journalism ethics. The discussion examines how notions of truth and facts become malleable though professional reasoning practices in pursuit of producing engaging news content and fulfilling the role of professional journalism. The discussion is situated within the current challenge to the credibility of professional journalism and the reemphasis on basic journalism principles of truth and facts in the face of a pervasive pall of public distrust. Part of the renewed emphasis of professional journalism practice is the importance of journalism ethics, of fact checking and using legitimate and credible sources. However, although inventing sources and manufacturing content would be seen as a clear breach of journalism ethics this blanket principle fails to take account of the lived day to day reality of journalists\u2019 professional reasoning and on the ground practices of producing news content. In highlighting the role of on-the-ground professional reasoning the discussion seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of journalism practices, some of which may involve acting counter to professional journalism ethics in order to produce professional content.", "The particular case examined below involves a Swiss news journalist, who, during an important public debate in the run up to a sensitive referendum, \u201ctakes a question\u201d from an invented audience member during the live televised political debate.1 In particular we are interested in why and how the journalists discuss the use (or not) of a fictitious audience member prior to the show: In so doing they deliberately go against standard journalist ethics concerning the use of invented sources or quotes. We begin by framing the research within the context of \u201creal false\u201d journalistic information, before introducing our methodology (see \u00a72). As for the data, it includes the discussions before the show as well as the question being asked during the show. Starting at the end point of ethical trajectory, where the fictitious questioner is invoked, our analysis then returns to the context of televised political debates in Switzerland before focusing our analysis on the editorial meeting the day before the show. Our main focus then, is on the backstage preparation by the journalists in considering how \u201cbad\u201d journalistic practice was brought into being for \u201cgood\u201d organisational reasons, and how this raises a number of issues posed by news journalism practices."]}, {"title": "Real False Information: What Truth is in the News Media", "paragraphs": ["In order to inform, journalists have as a \u201cfirst obligation [\u2026] the respect of the truth\u201d (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2014, 18). As such, journalists are often seen as more or less critical mediators of social realities who are at the service of the public (see Montgomery 2007; Machin and Niblock 2006; Kuhn and Neveu 2002). This implies a form of independence in the practice of the profession, the requirement to verify the information produced, and the desire to offer the public a platform to express a plurality of critical voices. However, this ideal picture is often at odds with everyday journalistic work. Rather the journalism product is less the result of a simple mediation than that of a construction constrained by complex practical day-to-day imperatives as well as ideological, ethical and commercial concerns, which often hinder the fulfilment of the pure news-media requirements (see Bourdieu 1998; Lo Verso 2015; Badillo et al. 2016).", "While classic ethnographies documented the work of the newsroom (Tuchman 1978; Schlesinger 1978; Schudson 2003; Cottle 2000), more recently, the study of the way journalists work has focused on the detail of the processes of news production (Perrin et al. 2008; Perrin et al. 2009; Cotter 2010; Tobback and Jacobs 2013). This form of ethnographic study examines in detail, how journalists construct and reconstruct information for their public (Perrin and Zampa 2016; Burger and Delaloye 2016; Rocci and Luciani 2016; Merminod 2016; Jacobs 2018). Going backstage, observing journalists behind the scenes, highlights routine filtering of processes which is itself moulded in mediagenia and newsworthiness, often against ethical codes of news journalism. Indeed, in the day-to-day work of the news room, the formula suggested by Evgeny Morozov, in a blog of the French news outlet Le Monde Diplomatique 2, sums up the journalistic view, that the truth is first of all what marries logistics and spectacularisation. For example, video footage arriving too late to be edited into a report then compels the journalist to look for equivalent images in the archives and cover up the subterfuge; the tense breathing of a person severely wounded in an air disaster is \u201ccopy-pasted\u201d and enhanced and then associated with another person; the sound of helicopter rota blades overlaid onto footage of the 9/11 attacks; \u201crounded\u201d numbers or \u201cshocking\u201d words used to stimulate images that are too \u201csmooth\u201d all characterise journalistic processes where the literally fake dominates and is legitimised by editorial imperatives (see Jaworski, Fitzgerald, and Constantinou 2005; Perrin 2013; Merminod and Burger in press; Burger and Delaloye 2018).", "Clearly the advent of digital technology has and continues to have profound impacts on journalism which have undergone significant changes in the face of technological advances and affordances. First, it is no longer relevant to distinguish television, radio and press journalism: all media are available online and thus align themselves with new user habits (Badillo et al. 2016; Marchand 2016; SRG-SSR 20153). Mostly delinearised and accessed through mobile devices (smartphone, digital tablet), journalists have had to rethink both formats and contents, as well as finding new ways of financing their work where \u201cnews of the day\u201d can be obtained for free (Sadin 2016; Morozov 2017). The profits of the digital infrastructure, dominated by online advertising and directed by large corporations (Google, Facebook), encourage content that is likely to be shared. Finally, in an era where \u201cpost-truth\u201d has emerged as an important perspective of political communication4, and where technology makes it possible to massively produce and disseminate \u201cready-made-home-made\u201d news, the truth of information has taken an unprecedented turn. Journalists, institutionally recognised experts in the production of news, are now competing with other news disseminators such as politicians and ordinary citizens (see Thornborrow 2015; Ekstr\u00f6m and Lundell 2011), including \u201cnews\u201d that is deliberately produced as disruptive misinformation, for example, Breitbart, the Drudge Report, or satire such as The Onion and Real News Right Now). In this environment, false becomes commonplace or is characterised as \u201calternative\u201d facts, which serves to, and is used to, challenge any journalism.5", "In this environment non-verified information and fake news is less of a problem because of its content than it is as to the speed and ease of its dissemination (Morozov 2017). Thus, not only do journalists have to come to terms with a changing news environment, they are also having to come to terms with profound changes in news gathering: they now need to redefine and promote their expertise rather then it being taken for granted. Indeed, where previously \u201cthe brand, the popularity of a newspaper or a channel was [the] predominant criterion of what was read, listened to or watched, today, friend recommendations on Facebook or Twitter and Google algorithms have become essential if also problematic\u201d (Roger De Weck, Director of SSR-SRG, for Migros Magazine 24, June 10, 2013). According to the practitioners themselves, journalists must now reaffirm a basis for their work and a professional raison d'\u00eatre such that \u201cwe must, as citizens, defend once again the democratic ideal: \u201ceveryone has the right to join in, to participate [\u2026] as journalists, our social legitimacy is to serve the \u2018citizens\u2019 right to know\u2019\u201d (Edwy Plenel, director of Mediapart).6 As Perez points out, the status of information and the role of professionals: \u201c(to) select the essential news among the mass of documents and thus (to) give meaning to this raw information, while protecting sources. In short, a return to usual deontological practices\u201d is where journalism needs to return to (Benito Perez, editorialist, Le Courrier de Gen\u00e8ve, December 7, 2010, our translation). However, in trying to articulate a collective place from which to rally around, journalists now find themselves in a different environment which requires a re-emphasis on serving the public for the public's interests, and also now demands that journalists constantly demonstrate they are doing this."]}, {"title": "Seeing From Behind the Scenes: A Multi-method Analysis", "paragraphs": ["While a return to the principles of honesty and integrity is called for by journalists, as indicated above their actual routine day-to-day practices often do not reflect this, as is the case of Swiss public service broadcasting examined below. While it is clear that the routine work of journalism may employ unethical practices from time to time, such fabrication of information is usually only accessible to the public on two conditions: when a \u201cleak\u201d reveals a practice in a sensitive context, or when one is granted access to the backstage of newsrooms. In both cases there is a tendency for journalists to reflexively self-legitimise their practices, exhibiting the gap between what they say they do and what they actually do.", "The study draws upon ethnographic data collected as part of a field study (2005\u20132016) undertaken in the editorial offices of the main German-speaking (SF1) and French-speaking (TSR1) television channels as well as in that of the largest Italian-language daily newspaper (Corriere del Ticino) in Switzerland.7 The overall research aim was to explore the discourse of news production through the negotiation processes that govern decision-making in editorial meetings, which in turn constrain the production of news.", "In the context of ethnographic approaches (Fassin 2013; Snel, Shaw, and Copland 2015; Rampton, Maybin, and Roberts 2015), in particular those oriented towards the observation of the news media (Cotter 2010; News, Talk & Text Research Group 2011; Ekstr\u00f6m and Lundell 2011; Perrin 2013; Tobback and Jacobs 2013), it\u2019s common to adopt different methods to better grasp the complexity of the object: in our case, the community of journalists in the Swiss public service. This involved interviews with decision-makers, i.e. the politicians and managers, and collecting observational data from the field involving 20 journalists from the three cultural and linguistic regions who were each followed at work for one week.", "As mentioned above, the data examined below is that of the preparatory sessions of a televised debate by an experienced journalist and his assistant at the Corriere del Ticino (in the Italian speaking part of Switzerland). For the analysis, the research adopted methods directly relevant to the study of multimodal oral data at the micro level, such as interaction analysis (Jones 2012; Norris and Jones 2005; Norris 2011; Scollon 2001; 2008) and membership categorisation analysis (Sacks 1995; Hester and Eglin 1997; Fitzgerald and Housley 2015). To better understand the link between ideal practices and actual practices, the research focused on two closely related dimensions: the uncovering of tacit knowledge and the journalists\u2019 management of \u201ccritical\u201d situations through the mobilisation of locally invoked specific know-how.8 Here then, managing a televised political debate potentially represents a \u201ccritical\u201d situation where the journalist anticipates such a situation and considers a solution that he will actually use in the context of the debate."]}, {"title": "The Televised Debate as a Critical Situation", "paragraphs": ["In March 2013, the Swiss population was asked to vote in favour of or against the so-called Minder initiative, named after the proposer of the initiative the MP Thomas Minder, who had gained the required signatures from the Swiss public to hold the vote. The Swiss political system is referred to as \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201dsemi-direct\u201d democracy. At any time, Swiss citizens can collect signatures on a project aimed at modification of the Federal Constitution. If they are able to gather 100,000 signatures, their amendment is subject to a national vote. Before the vote, it is debated in parliament, and in the national media (Bovet 2009). This particular initiative aimed to cap the executives\u2019 salaries and allowances which were considered abusive, and ending the practice of large companies guaranteeing huge severance payments to executives. For example, in the cases of Swissair in 2003 and Credit Suisse in 2009, billion-dollar losses were paid off by citizens after bankruptcy, while the CEOs received more than 5 years\u2019 salary in advance. The public debate was intense and culminated in February 2013 when D.

In doing so, he not only gives the pretence of this question coming spontaneously from a member of the audience, he also pretends to read this question from a \u201ctext\u201d sent by Marco, and is therefore pretending to \u201cquote\u201d Marco to the participants and audience.

One form of audience intervention, using an invented source, is a strategy that was discussed and prepared the day before by the journalist and his assistant, and which we turn to now.", "In observing the preparatory session, we can see that three interrelated processes emerge, considered as \u201cgood\u201d practices by the journalists themselves where the contingencies for critical action are planned. In terms of the debate\u2019s progression, MB and his assistant decide a priori appropriate moments for interventions (e.g. at the end of the show, before the final summary);In terms of content, to avoid the silence of the public, they list quotes from external sources that will be used to solicit responses from the debaters present on the set;They formulate an intervention themselves and attribute it to fictitious audience members.

The assistant then, after expressing her fear of a live broadcast where the public does not contribute questions, submits to MB extracts of conversations taken from the ongoing public debate that might be useful in such a case.  4.

The views of the latter, even if they are highly predictable, distance themselves from the extreme right-wing that dominates in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. Romano\u2019s statement, which has already appeared in the media, is considered very relevant by MB (line 397) because it broadens the scope of the debate.11 However, in the next extract (B), MB identifies the possible problem of using this as a quote.", "Table", "Here then N identifies an important editorial standard that the quotation satisfies in addition to its relevance (line 398: \u201cI thought it was a provocation\u201d). While MB initially agrees with the idea being suggested to exploit the quote (in the conditional tense, line 400), he gradually expresses his doubt (lines 403, 405, 406) before rejecting the proposal. MB identifies the problem as using a quote from a politician who is not going to be in the studio, and so not part of the live debate (line 406: \u201cyou quote a politician who is not there\u201d). Here then the journalists identify a relevant angle for the debate, and a journalistic reason for it being used during the debate as a provocation. In doing so, the journalists identify both the good and bad reasons for using/not using the quote and from this evaluation MB announces that they should \u201cdrop it\u201d, that it cannot be used.", "However, the matter is not quite settled. As examined in the next extract, N goes onto point out again that she thought it was a good provocation, i.e. that it fulfilled that aspect of the debate to be lively and engaging. From this, MB then begins to warm to the idea of using the quote but attributing it to a different person, a member of the audience.", "In the next extract the journalists continue to discuss the quote and start to tease out a solution to the problem. Returning first to identifying why it would be good journalist practice, as a provocation, they then set about finding a way that would allow them to use this quote.", "For this section of analysis, we draw on Membership Categorisation Analysis to highlight the way journalists organise, employ and deploy social category-based reasoning in the production of news (Eglin and Hester 2003). This is particularly visible during live news production, for example when major news crews were on hand to report from the house of the Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik responsible for 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack (Fitzgerald and Evans 2019). This \u201cnews-culture-in-action\u201d points to a process whereby individuals and individual actions are rendered into newsworthy membership categories who act according to their \u201cmembership\u201d, and who are treated as interacting or reacting with other newsworthy categories in action in routine predicable ways. In the example below, MB invokes a categorial based reasoning (Sacks 1995) tied to his \u201cprofessional\u201d knowledge of the audience and how the \u201caverage\u201d audience member engages with the news.", "Table", "In this extract, the quandary as to the use of the politician\u2019s quote is now placed alongside what the \u201cthe average reader\u201d might know or remember about who said it. MB suggests that the average reader would not be able to remember where they read something, only that they read it (line 414). MB, then, retains the idea of the question being worthy but not quotable, if from the politician, but also provides a way in which it could be used by shifting the focus to what the \u201caverage reader would know\u201d. In other words, MB denies the (quotation) form of N\u2019s proposition but upholds the (thematic) relevance of the content that he wants to exploit. The theme satisfies two essential constraints of the mediagenic aspect of news in a debate: to be of relevance (\u201cthe problem cannot be fought off only with legal provisions, we must change the culture\u201d: lines 395\u2013396) and at the same time spectacular in effect (\u201cI thought it could be a good provocation\u201d: line 409). Thus, in this move MB begins to provide for a separation between the content of the question and the author of the question. That is, while the point raised is undoubtedly relevant, it is unethical for a politician to be granted a voice when he/she is not taking part in the debate. Step one is to propose that the \u201caverage reader\u201d would not connect the argument with the politician.", "MB\u2019s professional category-based reasoning as a professional journalist provides grounds for \u201cknowing\u201d the audience, which in turn also means he is able to understand what the \u201caverage news reader\u201d knows. Indeed, in the interview conducted after the debate MB reported that one of his constant concerns was to \u201cput oneself in the public\u2019s shoes\u201d. In placing himself in the shoes of the \u201caverage reader\u201d (line 413)12, he is able to experience the programme as a member of the audience, and as such able to argue that the average member of the audience would not remember the specifics of what or where they have read the argument expressed by any particular person (line 414). Only an impression of the theme would \u201cstay[s] in his mind\u201d (line 417) and the average audience member would have internalised it and reformulated it \u201cas if it were his own\u201d (line 420). This account of how the audience think is predicated to MB\u2019s own experience as a professional journalist (\u201cthat\u2019s how it works\u201d: line 416). In short, for MB, the original proposal to use the quote is faulty, not because it is roundly unethical but that it only considers the content of the provocation and author of the contribution to the debate, and not the second part of the debate equation, the audience\u2019s engagement in public debate and how they would engage in this particular televised debate.", "With the two goals of the debate \u2013 to have a lively debate, and to have demonstrated audience engagement \u2013 MB is thus able to connect and reconcile the potentially unethical action with the wider professional and practical goals. In a practical sense, what he does on-air is blur, in Goffman\u2019s terms (1981), the \u201cprinciple\u201d and \u201cauthor\u201d of the question by shifting the principle from a particular author to a \u201cpublic\u201d author. In so doing he reconfigures the relationship between the author as someone, Marco Romano Politician, to the author as someone as anyone (Scannell 2000), i.e. Marco from Ponte Capriasca, audience member.13 Of course, whilst this action is performed for the audience, the journalist, in reality, is both \u201cauthor\u201d of the sentiment and \u201canimator\u201d of the question. Thus, for good professional reasons the journalist obfuscates the author and animator of the comment to produce live \u201cquality\u201d journalism, and so reconcile his professional categorial identity with the creation of a fictitious audience member. That is, it is from and because of his experience and professionalism that he then is able to connect the two elements and reconcile this apparently unethical action."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In this paper we have examined an instance of a Swiss journalist deliberately inventing an audience member in a live TV political debate. Drawing on the perspective of the journalists themselves, we have highlighted how they reason \u201cbad journalist practices for good journalism reasons\u201d. While at face value it is clear that the actions of the journalist were ethically problematic, we are not arguing that this shows that truth is relative or alternative.

Indeed, this aspect of journalism is not new and has been the subject of critical research since early studies of journalism.14 Rather, this research takes seriously and attempts to contribute further understanding to just how these practices are reconciled with such principles in practice, and more broadly how journalism ethics are managed in the face of the fragmentation of the audience and media products as well as new forms of political and media engagement through new forms of technology.", "Thus, while from an ontological point of view this fictionalisation represents a bad practice, from a practical point of view, which admits nuanced perspectives, it is done for good reasons. On the one hand, the requirement for truth as the foundation of journalism according to Kovach and Rosenstiel (2014) is constrained. On the other hand, the debate of ideas and the plurality of citizen voices are seemingly given voice. In doing this, the journalists are able to maintain, for them, what corresponds to the definition of \u201ctruth\u201d not as an absolute, but as a negotiated practice. Indeed, according to Barbie Zelizer and Stuart Allan: truth is approached by journalists not as an absolute entity but as a practical objective to be realized in newsmaking practices. [\u2026] It emerges through the journalist\u2019s ability to assemble and verify facts and to collect them in an account that approximates in a reliable and credible fashion some unfolding of action in the real world. (Zelizer and Allan 2010, 162)Of course, a major element within the emergence of \u201cpost truth\u201d, \u201cfake news\u201d and the \u201ccrisis of legitimation\u201d in journalism centres around the notion of trust. Can and should journalism be trusted? The attacks on journalism have been particularly effective in highlighting the separation between the \u201cprinciples\u201d in relation to truth and accuracy and the practice of journalism, where the day to day work of journalism means these ideals are routinely fudged, although possibly for good professional reasons. In light of this dissonance it is important to acknowledge that practices that are regarded as unethical in principle are routinely used and, indeed, form part of routine journalism practice for good reasons. Acknowledging this means opening up the discussion about day to day practices of journalism for a more candid understanding of such practices.", "truth is approached by journalists not as an absolute entity but as a practical objective to be realized in newsmaking practices.

(Zelizer and Allan 2010, 162)", "For example, in the case discussed here, the validity criterion of the \u201ctruth\u201d is neither the identity nor the identification of a source, but rather the intellectual contents or sentiment of the comments that circulate in public spaces and are within the public interest. In this case, then, the argument for quality journalism in Switzerland situates the news media in their primary role of being mediators of public interest for the public itself, i.e. a necessary and sufficient condition of the truth of journalistic information. It is this essential professional role of the journalist to circulate and mediate public discourses through their judgement, even if this means transgressions of journalism ethics when done for good professional reasons."]}], "references": [{"title": "Pratiques langagi\u00e8res des d\u00e9bats et constitution des espaces publics", "year": "2013", "journal": "Bulletin Vals-Asla", "volume": "98", "authors": [{"name": "Burger Marcel.", "first_name": "Burger", "last_name": "Marcel."}]}, {"title": "Argumentation in Journalism", "year": "2016", "journal": "Journal of Argumentation in Context", "volume": "5", "authors": [{"name": "Burger Marcel", "first_name": "Burger", "last_name": "Marcel"}, {"name": "Delaloye Laura", "first_name": "Delaloye", "last_name": "Laura"}]}, {"title": "\u2018Maybe There is a Very Simple Debate\u2019.
