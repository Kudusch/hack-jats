In this interpretation of the event, it was argued that, under a Labour council, schools in Birmingham had been given the freedom to practise a segregationist agenda, resulting in an infiltration of Islamist ideology. Through a radicalisation narrative, that locates the causes of terrorism with extremist thought, an issue of local governance and agency was transformed into an argument about terrorist radicalisation.

Using qualitative analysis, the article shows how the event was interpreted along ideological lines, with the conservative press reinforcing the current UK Government\u2019s policy of \u201cmuscular liberalism\u201d, an ideology that locates the rise of extremism in the \u201cpassive tolerance\u201d of previous approaches to diversity, in particular multiculturalism. In this interpretation of the event, allegations of an Islamist plot to take over schools in Birmingham were presented as established fact with the proposition that this had been enabled by excessive liberalism, resulting in separatism.1 In this environment, it was suggested that \u201cIslamist extremism\u201d had been allowed to flourish. In this way, an issue of local governance and agency was transformed into a debate about national security, due to dominant understandings of radicalisation that locate the causes of terrorism with extremist thought. Within this framework, one of the solutions offered to the problem (as part of a wider programme of counter-terrorism measures) is the strengthening of \u201cBritish values\u201d\u2014promoting integration through ideological constructions of national identity. The ideological construction is made more apparent by counter-discourse reported in The Guardian, which used the case to attack the Government\u2019s education policy. The case highlights the continued focus on Muslims as a \u201csuspect community\u201d, as the practice of Islam is interpreted as extremism, which is perceived as a route to terrorism.", "The Operation Trojan Horse case has its origins in a letter, sent to Birmingham City Council, that suggested there was an organised plot to remove headteachers and spread an Islamist ethos in Birmingham\u2019s schools (which it referred to as \u201cOperation Trojan Horse\u201d). It was later leaked to the media.2 It is not the first time this term has been used to describe Muslims living in Europe. Kundnani (2014, 245) recalls when Filip Dewinter, the leader of the Belgium Flemish nationalist group Vlaams Belang, told an Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, in 2005 that Islam in Europe was a Trojan Horse, which Kundnani argues symbolises ideas of Islam as a fifth column, an enemy within.", "The Sunday Times was the first newspaper to break the story, \u201cTop Academy Investigated for \u201cSidelining\u201d Non-Muslim Staff\u201d on February 23, 2014.3 Subsequent news reports contained allegations of gender segregation, forced prayers and talks from militant clerics (Allen 2014). What followed was a series of inspections of 21 Birmingham schools, in March and April 2014, by Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education, Children\u2019s Services and Skills), and further investigations by Birmingham City Council, the Department for Education and the Education Funding Agency (Cannizzaro and Gholami 2016). A controversial appointment, of Peter Clarke\u2014the Former Head of Counter Terrorism, to head up the Department for Education investigation, was made by Michael Gove, the then Education Secretary. The subsequent reports from these investigations were released in June and July 2014.", "Ofsted (2014) reported that there was evidence of an \u201corganised campaign to target certain schools\u201d and found that some governors had attempted to \u201cimpose and promote a narrow faith-based ideology\u201d in some of the schools. Five schools were placed in special measures.4 This included two schools that had previously been rated as \u201coutstanding\u201d (Ofsted 2013). The report by Clarke (2014) found no evidence of extremism but that \u201cthere are a number of people in a position of influence who either espouse, or sympathise with or fail to challenge extremist views\u201d.5 The local city council report (Kershaw 2014), however, found that the majority of schools in Birmingham were well governed, stating that \u201cthere is no evidence of a conspiracy to promote an anti-British agenda, violent extremism or radicalisation in schools in east Birmingham\u201d but pointed to governor malpractice in a minority of schools.", "Many sources, including the national media, immediately suggested that the letter was a hoax, sent by a disgruntled headteacher following her dismissal (Allen 2014). However, the story had all the elements of an Islamist scare story that would appeal to a Government and media organisations with an integrationist agenda. The story broke into a context following the revelations of several tabloid newspapers that high-profile food chains use halal meat, provoking accusations of creeping Sharia and Islamification, alongside growing media coverage of British jihadists leaving the United Kingdom to fight in Syria. The story was useful (for those parties) in drawing the connection between Islamification at home, extremism and radicalisation through British institutions, and terrorism. It provided central Government, with the media as its mouthpiece, with an opportunity to further manage minority communities and restrict civil rights in the professed interests of preventing terrorism. The story was transformed from one of school mismanagement to a security issue.6", "This was illustrated immediately by the reaction of both Michael Gove and Prime Minister David Cameron. On June 9, Michael Gove announced in the Commons that, in the wake of these allegations, all school children would be required to learn \u201cBritish values\u201d, the response implying that the schools involved were currently outside Britishness. On June 10, David Cameron held a press conference to set out these \u201cBritish values\u201d and on June 15 wrote an article in The Mail on Sunday defining these as \u201ca belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law\u201d. Whilst both qualified their statements with reference to Islamism as \u201ca perversion of Islam\u201d,7 Cameron reinforced the need for a policy of \u201cmuscular liberalism\u201d (discussed below), \u201cThat\u2019s what a genuinely liberal country does: it believes in certain values and actively promotes them\u201d.8 Michael Gove, who had previously pronounced on the necessity to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d (of extremists), echoed these comments when he appeared on BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday July 6, 2014, calling for a \u201crobust\u201d defence of \u201cliberal values\u201d to challenge \u201cextremist views\u201d in Britain\u2019s schools.", "I would argue that the Operation Trojan Horse case allowed central Government to strengthen its position, adopted under the previous Coalition Government (see the June 2011 review of Prevent, HM Government 2011) of placing extremist ideology more centrally as a route to terrorism (Kundnani 2014). By framing these activities as \u201cextremist\u201d, the story was told through a radicalisation narrative allowing for a renewed push for anti-extremist measures across the public sector, but especially in education. Moreover, it offers \u201cmuscular liberalism\u201d as a solution, using \u201cBritish values\u201d to shore up its policy of integration. It is not the intention of this article to interrogate the facts of the Trojan Horse case but to show how it has been ideologically framed within two differing national newspapers and to also suggest that the dominant interpretation supports central Government\u2019s current domestic and foreign policies."]}, {"title": "Context", "paragraphs": ["This event took place against a neoliberal socio-political backdrop that saw a Conservative-led government gathering momentum. The multicultural policies of the past had already given way to that of community cohesion (integration), under a new Labour government, in a post-terrorism environment further destabilised by economic uncertainty. This context provides a sympathetic setting for assertions of Britishness along ideological lines. The case is one of many that could be used to show how press discourse around Islam represents an attempt by various elite groups to construct a discourse of the nation and in doing so creates insiders and outsiders within a polarised identity politics. However, what was significant here was that this event allowed central Government to reinforce its doctrine of \u201cmuscular liberalism\u201d, taking New Labour\u2019s integrationist policies to another level. First muted at a Munich security conference in 2011, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, revealed his Government\u2019s approach to \u201cradicalisation and Islamic extremism\u201d, locating the blame for extremism within Muslim communities. Here, he argued that the policies of multiculturalism have allowed for an over-liberal \u201cpassive\u201d tolerance of difference and that, equally, an over-emphasis on ethnic identities has led to segregation and extremism. Liberal democracies like the United Kingdom should therefore become more \u201cmuscular\u201d in dealing with immigration as well as \u201cactively\u201d defending its \u201cliberal values\u201d (which are later defined as \u201cBritish\u201d). This, and subsequent speeches, work to entangle complex and often separate issues such as multiculturalism, immigration, extremism and terrorism, and propose particular strategies for protecting national security. In this article I will show how these ideas are evident in the representation of the Operation Trojan Horse case.", "The article draws on the work of Arun Kundnani (2014), in particular, his recent study of radicalisation in the United States and the United Kingdom. This extensive study, involving 160 interviews, criticises dominant constructions of the process of radicalisation that conflates political views with terrorism. His analysis of available research shows no demonstrable evidence between holding an Islamist ideology and committing acts of terrorism. Kundnani argues that the current phase of the war on terror, and its representations, sustains the idea of a terrorist threat (which to the West is marginal) and allows for the mass surveillance of Muslims and the repression of political views. Kundnani suggests that what was once a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d has now become permanent as people accept the erosion of their civil rights to allow the Government to manage \u201cextremism\u201d. In this way liberals (in the United States, under Obama) have normalised the counterterrorrism discourse that Islam gives rise to terrorism and therefore needs to be managed. For Kundnani, by drawing on research that equates ideology with terrorism, Governments conflate political dissent with political violence which allows them to survey all Muslims for these \u201cindicators of radicalization\u201d (118).9", "It is also pertinent to mention Prevent here. Prevent (Preventing Violent Extremism, HM Government 2006) is part of a strategy to counter terrorism, adopted by the last Labour Government following the 7/7 London bombings. It has been implemented in institutions where people (especially the young) are seen to be at particular risk from radicalisation, to identify and intercept in that process. This, according to Kundnani (2014, 135) is \u201cbased on an understanding of the process of radicalisation \u2009\u2026\u2009 whereby individual ideology is activated by a group dynamic\u2014institutions therefore can be \u2018radicalization incubators\u2019\u201d. We can see how this thinking has been applied to the Operation Trojan Horse case. Framed as an example of (organised) extremism in schools, it has allowed for further anti-terrorism legislation, which has strengthened the ability of government agencies to intervene in education. Prevent Duty, for example, which became law in June 2015, takes this strategy one step further by enlisting those working in education environments into the surveillance of \u201csuspects\u201d, in this case largely Muslims."]}, {"title": "Representations of Muslims and Islam", "paragraphs": ["A large and international body of evidence has grown over the past two decades that demonstrates the negativity towards Islam in the mainstream media of a number of \u201cWestern\u201d countries. Analyses of the UK press show how global Islam has been represented as conflictual, threatening, barbaric, despotic and misogynistic (Richardson 2004). Meanwhile British Muslims have been constructed as predominantly a cultural but also increasingly (since 7/7) a terrorist threat (Poole 2002, 2006, 2016). Subsequent studies have shown the continued focus on these themes and the increase in volume related to specific events and agendas (Greater London Authority 2007; Khiabany and Williamson 2008, 2015; Moore, Mason, and Lewis 2008; Morey and Yaqin 2011; Petley and Richardson 2011; Baker, Gabrielatos, and McEnery 2013; Mertens and d\u2019Haenens 2013). It is, of course, simplistic to homogenise the media in this way, counter-discourse exists even within single texts, but there is now sufficient evidence to assert that there is a distinct framework of reporting in relation to Islam and Muslims in the mainstream UK news media."]}, {"title": "Methods", "paragraphs": ["This article examines the representation of the Operation Trojan Horse case in two British newspapers, the Daily Mail and The Guardian, including all coverage in 2014. The database Nexis UK was searched using the terms in Table 1. Those articles referring to \u201cBritish values\u201d, given the focus of this paper, were selected for careful qualitative analysis although a reading of wider coverage was made to obtain an impression of the reporting overall. The Daily Mail is a middle-market tabloid with a conservative bias, and taking into account the Mail Online, is the most popular UK newspaper.10 A familiarity with coverage of this event across the British press enables me to argue that the Daily Mail\u2019s representation of the case was fairly standard as the bulk of the (conservative) press shared its interpretation on this issue. The Guardian is less popular but provides a contrast to the Daily Mail due to its left-leaning politics.11 It was included to demonstrate the counter-politics at play. Due to the focus on constructions of British values and identity, I also included coverage responding to David Cameron\u2019s article \u201cMy Faith in a Christian Country\u201d (Church Times, April 16, 2014), which provoked a significant debate and became part of the wider discussion on Britishness at the time. This study would benefit from a quantitative linguistic analysis, using basic automated processes, to identify word frequencies and combinations. This would extend our understanding of the discursive tendencies and topics covered in the newspapers, and further reveal their ideological construction while providing supporting evidence of this (see Baker, Gabrielatos, and McEnery 2013).

Using quantitative techniques, the study measured only the terms which related to evidence in the investigation, Islamist ideology was given as the causal factor in the majority of cases. The authors conclude that: Such a partial coverage relied on the press tradition of representing Islam and Muslims in terms of ideological dualisms and negative stereotypes, and on the textual strategy of selecting some features (extremism) whilst omitting others (of equal importance) (governors\u2019 misconduct, incompetence, personal politics and conflict of interests). The Trojan Horse news story was by and large represented as a case of Islamist extremism.

Looking specifically at the newspapers analysed in this article, the Daily Mail was more likely to represent the explanation as Islamist ideology rather than poor governance (64 per cent versus 36 per cent) with The Guardian the least likely (45 per cent versus 55 per cent).12 On this basis, they appear to represent opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of how this was represented in the UK press and are therefore useful cases for study. In this analysis, it was easy for the press to blame the jihadist threat for school failures over and above any alternative explanation, given that the discursive environment already existed and the public had been primed to receive this message."]}, {"title": "Press Representation: Radicalisation, Ideology and British Values", "paragraphs": ["Be More British Cameron Tells UK Muslims: PM Issues Powerful New Pledge to Combat Extremism School inspectors said that at some Muslim-dominated schools in Birmingham, pupils were taught that white women were \u201cprostitutes\u201d, boys and girls were segregated, Christmas events were scrapped, tombolas were banned as \u201cnon-Islamic\u201d and children in biology lessons were told that evolution was untrue.

This position suggests that ideology is responsible for extremism, and that this leads to terrorism, therefore any extreme ideas should be challenged, in this case with \u201cBritish values\u201d. There are several strategies in the Daily Mail\u2019s coverage here: the threat (to culture and security) is amplified by listing examples of \u201cextremism\u201d thought to have been practised at the school, and there is a conflation from conservativism to violence as these practices are linked to terrorism and extremism elsewhere (Iraq, Sharia law).13 That this is part of a broader pattern of thinking is reflected in the reporting of Tony Blair\u2019s comments linking Operation Trojan Horse to Boko Haram as part of a \u201cmovement that has spread across the world\u201d in \u201cTrojan School Plotters Share the Warped View of Terrorists\u201d (Jason Groves, June 16).", "In these articles, the allegations go unquestioned and are reported as fact. \u201cEvidence\u201d, such as separate Physical Education lessons for boys and girls, is reformulated as sex segregation and combined with other claims as proof of an Islamist plot.

In this article, Cameron defines British values as \u201ca belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law\u201d. These, he argues, are not exclusive but \u201crooted in our traditions and history\u201d (are based on a heritage that has become institutionalised). He suggests that the United Kingdom has been too liberal and this has allowed extremism to flourish, rather he defines and makes a claim to liberalism: \u201cThat\u2019s what a genuinely liberal country does: it believes in certain values and actively promotes them\u201d.

The Conservative Party have been strategic in appropriating oppositional positions, thus appearing to occupy the centre. Tough action can be justified by linking the growth of extremism to failed leftist policy and by characterising it as liberalism (Cameron\u2019s progressive conservatism).", "For the Mail, these are \u201cWise words, but now we need action\u201d (The Mail on Sunday comment, June 15). We should \u201caim this \u2018fightback\u201d at \u201cpreachers of hate\u201d (Walters, June 14). As we saw previously, those in the Trojan Horse case have already been associated with extremist ideas (see Groves, June 16), and so anyone holding conservative views or speaking out against the Government, can be categorised as such, creating a \u201csuspect community\u201d.", "Having said this, the muscular liberalism of Cameron (Obama, and previously Blair) differentiates between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d Muslims by arguing Islamist extremism emerges out of a distorted ideology and is not representative of ordinary Muslims, adopting a reformist approach to Islam (Kundnani 2014). Either way, the Governors who sought to bring Islamic values to these schools are deemed as circulating extremism and criminalised. By understanding the process of radicalisation in this way, any circulation of \u201cextremist\u201d ideas must be countered. Here, \u201cBritish values\u201d are used to counteract oppositional viewpoints. The fact that they are loosely defined, through a set of universal principles, leaves the concept empty enough to be filled in opposition to any opinion that the Government may find offensive, closing down the free speech they purport to defend. However, by identifying them as \u201cBritish\u201d constructs an Othering discourse, rendering these universal values as exclusive, so anyone holding oppositional views is perceived as non-British and treated with suspicion.", "In Clark and Pleasance\u2019s early report on Operation Trojan Horse (Mail Online, April 21), a banner titled \u201cRelated Articles\u201d directs you to coverage of an additional story, that broke around the same time, which also engages with questions of national identity. This follows the publication of another article written by the Prime Minister for the Church Times, \u201cMy Faith in a Christian Country\u201d (April 16, 2014), in which he claims that Britain is a Christian country and professes \u201ca desire to \u2018infuse politics\u2019 with \u2018Christian values\u201d. These ambitions to expand \u201cthe role of faith-based organisations\u201d in society appear to exclude Islam, given the reaction to the Operation Trojan Horse case. His stance is denounced in an open letter from the British Humanist Society (supported by over 50 academics, writers and broadcasters), published in The Telegraph on Easter Monday (April 20), which claims that Britain is a plural society and to suggest otherwise \u201cfosters alienation and division\u201d. This provoked a national debate about the character of contemporary Britain which was reported internationally.", "The Daily Mail takes a clear position defending the Prime Minister, and his claim that the United Kingdom is a Christian country, in all seven of its articles. Coverage emphasises \u201cBritain\u2019s Christian heritage\u201d, and uses high-profile elite sources to support this, such as Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury (Matt Chorley, April 24), but also other faith leaders such as Farooq Murad, of the Muslim Council of Great Britain: \u201cNo one can deny that Britain remains largely a Christian country, with deep historical and structural links with the established Church\u201d (April 30).", "Part of its argumentative strategy is to provide evidence from politics, history and the arts, as well as statistics: \u201c60 per cent of Britons identify as Christian\u201d (Stephen Glover, April 22). A \u201cpersecution of Christians\u201d narrative is also evident, using high-profile cases of Christians whose practices have been censored, for example, Nadia Eweida, an employee of British Airways, who was asked to cover up a Christian cross, and was placed on unpaid leave when she refused either to do so, or to accept a position where she did not have to cover it up (Paul Donnelly, April 27). \u201cIn practice, of course, it also means that Islam, which brooks no mockery or disrespect, grows strong while the gentler voice of Anglicanism grows fainter and fainter until it is blown away on the breeze\u201d (Hitchens, April 27).", "Whilst on the one hand, the Daily Mail therefore appears to support Cameron\u2019s liberalist position, this story allows it to adopt a stronger stance, to re-assert the Christian identity that it perceives as being under attack. It uses more opinionated voices to make these arguments: Peter Hitchens, for example, who describes himself as \u201cpolitically conservative/Christian right\u201d. He uses the platform to attack the liberal establishment, including \u201cmilitant atheists\u201d. This includes the \u201ccelebrity atheists\u201d and the \u201canti-God squad\u201d that signed the British Humanist Society letter. Elsewhere they are described as \u201caggressive\u201d, \u201cunpleasant\u201d, \u201cself-rightous\u201d (Jason Groves and Louise Eccles, April 22) and even \u201cextremist\u201d by Glover (April 22). This persecution of Christians/Islamification narrative is a theme of the conservative press and has been identified elsewhere in coverage of Muslims (Knott, Poole, and Taira 2013). It serves not only to attack Muslims for their prohibitive actions but liberal elites for introducing policies that undermine Christianity and British values. This type of coverage rallies support for a more muscular politics. It therefore worked in parallel to the reporting of the Operation Trojan Horse case in constructing ideas about British identity: \u201cAlongside values which are religiously based, there has to understanding that this is the UK and there is a set of values\u2014some of which I would say are Christian based\u2014which permeate our sense of citizenship\u201d (Laura Clarke, April 21).", "In the reporting of this story, the Daily Mail adopts a culturalist position towards Islam; that extremism is inherent within it and at odds with Western culture (Kundnani 2014).", "The Guardian makes an interesting case study due to its left-leaning politics which resulted in quite a singularly different interpretation of this event in its reporting. In a political move the newspaper uses the case to attack Ofsted, and central Government, for undermining \u201cBritish Values\u201d, and the Government for their \u201cliberalisation\u201d of the education system. Its approach is evident in \u201c\u2018All Schools Must Promote \u2018British Values\u2019, Says Gove: Education Secretary Seizes on Birmingham Reports\u201d (Richard Adams, Patrick Wintour, and Steven Morris, June 10, emphasis added). This article, reporting on Gove\u2019s response to Ofsted\u2019s findings, is cynical about the Government\u2019s motives, portraying them as opportunist. It rarely refers to extremism, only to say where schools have been cleared, and concentrates on issues of governance. Its language is more measured, suggesting some schools \u201crequire improvement\u201d and it does not refer to radicalisation. The responses of three of the accused schools are included. Initially, it questions the \u201cevidence\u201d and concludes: In Birmingham, the leader of the Labour-run council, Sir Albert Bore, said he was \u201cvery reassured\u201d that Ofsted had not uncovered evidence of a coordinated plot or conspiracy to seize control of schools but said it was clear some governors and governing bodies had \u201cfailed in their duties\u201d to pupils. (Adams, Wintour, and Morris, June 10)", "In Birmingham, the leader of the Labour-run council, Sir Albert Bore, said he was \u201cvery reassured\u201d that Ofsted had not uncovered evidence of a coordinated plot or conspiracy to seize control of schools but said it was clear some governors and governing bodies had \u201cfailed in their duties\u201d to pupils. (Adams, Wintour, and Morris, June 10)", "The Government\u2019s neoliberal free market policy comes under attack: In the Commons, the shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said Gove\u2019s \u201cagenda has been an ideology of atomisation and fragmentation: teachers without qualifications; every school an island; a free market of provision; and an attempt to oversee it all from behind a desk in Whitehall. Birmingham has shown that that model is bust. (Adams, Wintour, and Morris, June 10)", "In the Commons, the shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said Gove\u2019s \u201cagenda has been an ideology of atomisation and fragmentation: teachers without qualifications; every school an island; a free market of provision; and an attempt to oversee it all from behind a desk in Whitehall. Birmingham has shown that that model is bust. (Adams, Wintour, and Morris, June 10)", "In reporting the tensions between Ofsted and Michael Gove, The Guardian again demonstrates a political agenda, but in doing so provides a more balanced analysis of Ofsted\u2019s findings (June 11).", "The newspaper is critical of the concept of \u201cBritish Values\u201d from the outset. Its early coverage on this features a report on a letter written to The Guardian by Sir Tim Brighouse (former Birmingham Education officer) and 20 other leading educationalists who state \u201cOfsted (is) being guided by an ideology at odds with the traditional British values which schools are meant to espouse, particularly fairness, justice and respect for others\u201d (June 3, emphasis added). There are various other examples of critique, on how British values are being defined, for example, in \u201cDear Mr Gove: What\u2019s So \u2018British\u2019 About Your \u2018British Values?\u201d, Michael Rosen challenges central Government on their own record in exhibiting these values, as well as questioning their uniqueness to Britain (July 1). On June 20, The Guardian\u2019s Education correspondent, Richard Adams, reports on the Government\u2019s stipulation that funding should be dependent on schools being able to demonstrate \u201cFundamental British Values\u201d. Adams argues that the term is too broad and that the Government has too much power to define these, and with this, the power to decide who is too extreme, potentially excluding Muslims from school Governing Bodies. Elsewhere, he mocks the policy in \u201ctoddlers must learn British values\u201d (August 8). Instead, British values are used in The Guardian in a defence of multiculturalism, to celebrate plurality, diversity (June 17) and to highlight the illiberalism in central Government policy.", "So, in The Guardian the Government is constructed as being undemocratic. There is more complexity in its coverage and it highlights the \u201cprejudice\u201d and \u201cscare-mongering\u201d (Owen Jones, June 23) in its policies. As well as featuring Muslim perspectives, concern is voiced for the well-being of Muslims in Birmingham, in the fallout of this case (Robin Richardson, June 3). It is careful with its terminology and refers to those accused as \u201cconservative\u201d rather than radical (Adams, June 20). In this way, it provides quite a different construction of this event to the dominant conservative narrative. However, due to its focus on Government Education policy, it spends less time critiquing and investigating the initial claims made about Islamification: \u201cAs for the Birmingham \u2018conspiracy\u2019, that, too, is more complicated than it seems: while there have undoubtedly been moves to Islamise the schools\u2019 curricula and atmosphere, much of the pressure in this direction has come from parents\u201d (Christopher de Bellaigue, July 23).", "There is some acceptance in its reporting that the claims have substance. This has been particularly evident in the subsequent reporting of the disciplinary hearings of some of the teachers involved in the case (October 2015). At this point, it appears to have accepted the claim that there was an organised attempt to Islamicise some schools (hence the trials, although it continues to be more careful in the language it uses). This demonstrates the strength of the official narrative on this issue that has largely been unchallenged in the mainstream. Whilst it is not the aim of this article to establish the facts of this case, following meetings with representatives of various stakeholder groups in Birmingham, as well as parents and governors, it would appear that there are claims of misrepresentation which require further investigation (see letter from Putting Birmingham School Kids First, The Guardian, June 20, 2014). Some of the schools\u2019 employees argued that accusations made against them were not proven or based on facts. For example, there were questions around the impartiality of Ofsted and how this impacted on their investigation. It was alleged that inspectors did not go into some schools, or speak to the governors concerned, but relied heavily on hearsay and anecdotal evidence rather than observed practice (private meeting).14 There was an insufficient interrogation of the actualities of the case, even in The Guardian.", "In the \u201cIs Britain a Christian country\u201d? debate, reporting, editorial and opinion in The Guardian is largely cynical towards the Government\u2019s motives, perceiving them as politically expedient, in trying to win back its core voting constituency before the impending general election. It is dismissive of the claim and puts forward several counter-arguments: that Cameron is \u201cdivisive\u201d and his position \u201cahistorical\u201d (in bringing religion into the political sphere), it questions some of the statistics offered as proof, and presents its own evidence such as \u201cdwindling church attendances\u201d (April 18). It also points out that there is a difference between claiming that Christianity is an \u201cimportant part of British national life\u201d to identifying it \u201cas a distinguishing aspect of British identity\u201d (April 18, their emphasis).", "There is also a secularist thread. The newspaper uses a number of secular and atheist commentators who endorse the arguments made by the British Humanist Society. The debate led to the Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, Nick Clegg, making the case for disestablishment (the separation of state and religion). Whilst this position was strongly criticised in the Daily Mail, The Guardian uses much of its coverage (including an Editorial) to support it. In a feature by atheist Julian Baggani, the author slams \u201creligious schools, automatic seats in the House of Lords for bishops or increased involvement of faith groups in delivering state-sponsored public services\u201d, claiming \u201cThere isn\u2019t much to complain about in such tepid claims for faith. It\u2019s only when religion is brought into the workings of government and state that we should be worried\u201d (April 22).", "Only one opinion piece (out of 12 articles) goes against the grain of this argument, agreeing with Cameron\u2019s viewpoint, but on the basis of adherence to rituals rather than belief (Christina Patterson, April 28)."]}, {"title": "Sources and Actors", "paragraphs": ["An analysis of the central actors in these articles shows that The Guardian uses a greater number and variety of sources, whereas the Daily Mail relies on institutional/establishment sources. In the Daily Mail, a total of 18 actors could be identified, predominantly central Government, Opposition and former politicians, and local councillors. Only four other voices appeared on solitary occasions and the end of articles\u2014one parent, a headteacher, a representative from the Park View Education Trust and Talha Ahmed of the Muslim Council of Britain. In The Guardian, 37 actors could be identified (only counting the letter from the British Humanist Society, signed by over 50 academics, once). Whilst the majority again were establishment figures, more Opposition MPs and official organisations (British Association of Early Childhood Education, British Humanist Association, etc.) were used to criticise central Government policy (rather than in support of the Government as in the Daily Mail). The Guardian was much more likely to refer directly to the reports of the investigating organisations and use a greater variety of actors within one article. Out of 37 actors, they included the voices of 14 schools plus representatives of the teaching profession. However, whilst many voices were oppositional in The Guardian, only six Muslim voices were evident including a parent, former student, teaching assistant, the Park View Education Trust and the Muslim Council of Britain. Pupil\u2019s voices were also absent from the debate."]}, {"title": "Impact", "paragraphs": ["For most of the press, this case was presented as one issue\u2014\u201cextremism\u201d\u2014when many were at stake\u2014professional and educational (Howarth 2014). Ofsted did in fact find evidence of poor governance, such as incompetence and professional misconduct, but this \u201crepresentational absence\u201d represents a discursive shift, absolving officials of responsibility and conveniently locating this with a pre-existing enemy (Cannizzaro and Gholami 2016). Whilst The Guardian did examine education policy, its main objective was to attack central Government for creeping privatisation. This led to other, equally significant discussions, being omitted. For example, in order to provide more agency and autonomy to minority communities, the local Labour council has encouraged parents to participate in schools that were 95\u201399 per cent Muslim in the area. Instead of acknowledging this and recognising the huge successes this brought in attainment, this was perceived as infiltration, again marginalising communities and undoing the achievements of the last 20 years. Previously model citizens were therefore reformulated as outsiders. Awan (2014) has observed the damage to community cohesion and children\u2019s self-esteem following the publicity around this case. In interviews with 50 parents, teachers, governors and local residents, 95 per cent felt that the case had damaged community cohesion and 90 per cent thought the media had distorted the case. Many felt that the label of extremist had been applied universally and that this closes down future opportunities for the children involved, in particular, but also for all Muslim children.", "As the Government sought to further embed Prevent into education policy, this case presented \u201cthe evidence\u201d that was needed to justify this. It has allowed for the further dismantling of anti-racism in schools evident in the revisions to guidance on Religious Education and the erosion of an anti-racist curriculum in teacher education (Smith and Lander 2012; Smith 2014). The erosion of the language of (ethnic) equality in teachers standards in recent years is in stark contrast to the directives around \u201cFundamental British Values\u201d and is evidence of the Government\u2019s ideological stance (Smith 2013, 2014).15 \u201cHere\u201d, Smith argues, \u201chomogeneity is overtly valued through an overarching assimilationist agenda. Deficit is now more openly articulated as attached to those who need to assimilate\u201d (Smith 2013, 443). Part of the objective could be perceived as \u201cwhite-washing\u201d, removing Muslims from public positions, reverting to a colonial anti-democratic model of governing."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Despite the central allegation of an Islamist plot to gain control of these schools (both operationally and ideologically) never being proved, and the language of Ofsted being measured in its reporting, press coverage (demonstrated here by the Daily Mail) slipped from allegation to fact, with small pieces of evidence exaggerated. In this way, the conservative press constructed the story of this case and how it should be interpreted. Having already been primed, the evidence becomes irrelevant, as the story fits with previous \u201ctruths\u201d. Problems of governance were reformulated as an issue of national security. What was presented was a radicalisation narrative, where Islamist groups are infiltrating ordinary schools and corrupting vulnerable children through extremist ideology. In this narrative, ideology is perceived as a route to terrorism and therefore must be countered (Kundnani 2014). In this way a local issue is linked to a wider global threat. The solution is to strengthen the integrationist agenda and remove difference from public spaces. This discourse has become so normalised that it has \u201cset the terms of reasonable debate\u201d (Howarth 2014). Other views are illegitimate, to dissent is to be an apologist for extremism and terrorism. The aim is to proscribe a common identity but with a concept so open\u2014Fundamental British Values\u2014this can be redefined as and when needed. Meanwhile, it allowed the Government to appear to be taking action on terrorism (following Woolwich16 and in the run-up to a General Election) and to justify a raft of counter-terrorism legislation that impinges on civil liberties. Unfortunately, the outcome is counter-productive, depoliticising (rather than engaging) and alienates an already marginal community.", "The construction of British values, in this case, is the continuation and extension of an identity politics that has been in progress since the 1989 Rushdie Affair, but especially since the war on terror, which forces people to take sides. Muscular liberalism (becoming less tolerant) is justified as a response to \u201ctheir\u201d intolerance and in this way Liberalism has become part of this identity politics (Kundnani 2014, 113). An over-liberal tolerance (including multiculturalism) has been blamed for creating an environment, in allowing difference, where radicalisation is possible. This discourse has allowed the right to redefine liberalism from progressive to \u201cmuscular\u201d, a version of state liberalism that continues to be \u201cunderpinned by an ideology of superiority and difference\u201d (Khiabany 2014). The reporting of Operation Trojan Horse can be seen as part of this wider hegemonic project, an ideological battle it appears to be winning. Whilst The Guardian strongly challenged the concept of \u201cBritish values\u201d, criticised central Government\u2019s education policy and provided space for oppositional voices, the official version of events appears to have been largely accepted, in its reporting of the criminal trials of teachers, for example (October 2015). The radicalisation narrative has also been more widely accepted which has paved the way for muscular liberalism. The aim of this article is to demonstrate, through theoretical and empirical analysis, how the reporting of this event offered an ideological interpretation which served a specific political agenda. However, the cost of reinforcing this cultural identity politics will continue to be felt by all but, most adversely, by those at the bottom of society."]}], "references": [{"title": "Operation Trojan Horse: Islamophobia or Extremism?", "year": "2014", "journal": "Political Insight", "volume": "5", "authors": [{"name": "Awan Imran.", "first_name": "Awan", "last_name": "Imran."}]}, {"title": "The Devil is Not in the Detail: Representational Absence and Stereotyping in the \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 News Story", "year": "2016", "journal": "Race, Ethnicity and Education", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Cannizzaro Sara", "first_name": "Cannizzaro", "last_name": "Sara"}, {"name": "Gholami Reza", "first_name": "Gholami", "last_name": "Reza"}]}, {"title": "Veiled Bodies \u2014 Naked Racism: Culture, Politics and Race in The Sun", "year": "2008", "journal": "Race and Class", "volume": "50", "authors": [{"name": "Khiabany Gholam", "first_name": "Khiabany", "last_name": "Gholam"}, {"name": "Williamson Milly", "first_name": "Williamson", "last_name": "Milly"}]}, {"title": "Free Speech and the Market State: Race, Media and Democracy in New Liberal Times", "year": "2015", "journal": "European Journal of Communication", "volume": "30", "authors": [{"name": "Khiabany Gholam", "first_name": "Khiabany", "last_name": "Gholam"}, {"name": "Williamson Milly", "first_name": "Williamson", "last_name": "Milly"}]}, {"title": "Cultural Values in Press Reporting on Islam: The UK and Flanders Compared", "year": "2013", "journal": "Australian Journalism Review", "volume": "35", "authors": [{"name": "Mertens Stefans", "first_name": "Mertens", "last_name": "Stefans"}, {"name": "d\u2019Haenens Leen", "first_name": "d\u2019Haenens", "last_name": "Leen"}]}, {"title": "A Critique of the Teaching Standards in England (1984\u20132012): Discourses of Equality and Maintaining the Status Quo", "year": "2013", "journal": "Journal of Education Policy", "volume": "28", "authors": [{"name": "Smith Heather.
