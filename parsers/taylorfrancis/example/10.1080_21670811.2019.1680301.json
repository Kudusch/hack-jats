Content analysis of 3010 articles shows that men are approximately twice as likely to be cited as sources as women. The analysis also finds a negative association between articles about public affairs topics and the presence of women as news sources. It also yields an increased use of women sources in stories with a female byline. Furthermore, there is no significant relationship between the presence of women as sources and whether the article was posted on the homepage of a news organization or its social media accounts. We draw on these findings to theorize on the role of technological change in the dynamics of gender inequality, and to reflect on how the relative dearth of women\u2019s voices in news stories may hinder diversity and inclusion in the public sphere.", "body": [{"title": "", "paragraphs": ["During the last 3 years, women all over the world raised their voices and demanded to be heard, both on the streets and on the media. Expressions of this trend can be found in movements such as #MeToo, which started in the USA and then became global (Dvorak 2017), and the women-led movement against Bolsonaro in Brazil (Carranca, 2018). Those in Argentina were not the exception since social movements like #NiUnaMenos\u2014\u201c#NotOneWomanLess\u201d\u2014which had been around since 2015, had already prepared the groundwork for societal discussions over gender equality (Batista et\u00a0al. 2017; Friedman 2016; Luengo 2018). In this context of struggle for gender equality, a question arises: do the news media provide equal opportunities for women to express themselves?", "Feminist media scholarship has examined the lack of gender parity in both news content and newsroom staff (Barnes 2017; Gallagher 2002; Ross 2010; Ross and Carter 2011; Strong 2007; Trappel, 2019). Concerning news content, research has documented the existence of gender imbalance in sourcing: men outnumber women as sources and are given more relevance (Armstrong 2006; De Swert and Hooghe 2010; Niemi and Pitk\u00e4nen 2016; Rodgers and Thorson 2003; Ross 2007; Zoch and Turk 1998). Studies on this topic have examined a number of variables that might explain the shortage of women\u2019s voices, such as media\u2019s reliance on official sources (D\u00edaz and Mellado 2017), and gendered newsroom cultures, which include fewer women journalists, placed in less prestigious beats (Allan, Branston, and Carter 2002; Armstrong 2004; Global Media Monitoring Project 2015; Manning 2000; Niemi and Pitk\u00e4nen 2016; Salda\u00f1a, Sylvie, and McGregor 2016).", "This article seeks to contribute to this existing research through an examination of gendered patterns in sourcing within the leading players in digital news in Argentina during 2017. Drawing on liberal feminist media scholarship, which has analyzed the representation of women in the media (Gallagher 2002; Newbold 1995; Ross 2010; Van Zoonen 1988), we explore to what extent online news organizations presented equalitarian voice opportunities. We concentrate on the Argentine context to complement the traditional geographic focus of most scholarship on Europe and North America. We examine digital media also to complement this scholarship\u2019s focus on broadcast and print media. This is particularly important because over the past couple of decades a significant portion of news consumption has migrated online\u2014both through dedicated websites and on social media platforms. Argentina is no exception to this trend since news is consumed mainly through websites and social media according to the 2018 Digital News Report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (Reuters News Report 2018). This article examines patterns in the gender distribution of sources, and the factors associated with these patterns\u2014including gender of the journalist, topic of the article, and venue of publication\u2014in news stories on eight Argentine online news sites and their social media accounts."]}, {"title": "Gender and Sources", "paragraphs": ["Liberal feminism seeks to integrate women into the public sphere and obtain equality between women and men (Lotz 2003) and proposes that media content both reflects and strengthens discrimination against women, by including fewer women than men and portraying them according to sex-role stereotypes when they do appear (Gallagher 2003; Tuchman 1978; Van Zoonen 1996). Although the liberal feminist perspective has been criticized for focusing on \u201cindividual rights and freedoms\u201d rather than on \u201csocial responsibility\u201d (Mendes 2012, 558), media act as socialization agents, \u201cteaching children (\u2026) their appropriate sex roles\u201d (Van Zoonen 1996, 34), and thus the way women are portrayed in the news has effects on the society as a whole.", "Scholarship on representation in news sources is grounded on the premise that being a source implies an opportunity to define a stance on an issue, and to respond to other sources who have different ideas (Franklin and Carlson 2010), Thorsen and Jackson propose that \u201cthe key question of sourcing practices (is) who is given authority to frame an event\u201d (2018, 847). Journalists search for sources that are available and story appropriate (Berkowitz 2009; Franklin and Carlson 2010; Gans 1979; Shoemaker and Mayfield 1987). Because of time constraints and organizational pressures, reporters need to routinize their tasks, including the sourcing process. This results in bias favoring certain sources\u2014usually elite or official sources, such as politicians and entrepreneurs\u2014to the detriment of other voices (Berkowitz 2009; Gans 1979; Johnson, Paulussen, and van Aelst 2018; Tuchman 1972).", "Scholarship on news sources has consistently observed that male sources appear more frequently and prominently than women sources (Armstrong 2006; De Swert and Hooghe 2010; Freedman, Fico, and Durisin 2010; Padovani, Raeymaeckers, and De Vuyst 2019; Rodgers and Thorson 2003; Ross 2007; Soley 1992; Zoch and Turk 1998). Research concurs that the presence of women as sources in the news media remains close to 30% (Morris 2016; Niemi and Pitk\u00e4nen 2016; Tiffen et\u00a0al. 2014). It has been argued that the gender gap stems in part from patterns such as media\u2019s reliance on authoritative and official sources. According to this line of research, the underrepresentation of women in powerful positions contributes to their low presence as sources (Global Media Monitoring Project 2015; Shor et\u00a0al. 2015). Thus, because men occupy more prestigious positions in our societies, \u201cthe reporter-source relationship tends to legitimate or even reify the power structure of society\u201d (Berkowitz 2009, 109).", "There is also inequality in how women are cited. Research has shown that they are associated with topics that have traditionally been associated with women, treated in a stereotypical manner, and their occupations differ from those of men who are included as sources (Soley 1992; Rodgers and Thorson 2003; Ross 2007; Van Zoonen 1988). De Swert and Hooghe\u2019s analysis of the presence of women as sources in Belgian news finds that the odds that a woman will be included as a source are twice as high for traditional \u201cfemale topics,\u201d such as \u201cculture, family, education, celebrity, royalty and healthcare\u201d than for other topics (2010, 75). Studies in countries that have achieved greater gender parity have found that even when controlling for the mediation of societal factors there is a tendency to underrepresent women\u00b4s voices (Edstrom and Molster 2014; Kahn 1994). Niemi and Pitk\u00e4nen (2017) explore the situation in Finland, where women are highly educated and have high levels of participation in the job market, and deduce that low representation of female experts in news cannot be explained by macro-level factors alone. Thus, in their study they have shown that women as sources were not proportional to the number of women in powerful positions and female academics were contacted less than their male counterparts, even when they were as willing to appear as experts (2017). Furthermore, disparity persists even when a source is cited as a regular citizen (Global Media Monitoring Project 2015). As Ross concludes, \u201cif Joe Public struggles to register on the journalistic radar, Joanne Public is almost entirely invisible as citizen although she is occasionally asked to speak in her role as mother\u201d (2007, 455).", "Scholars have also examined whether the gender gap in sources results from gendered newsroom cultures, which include the underrepresentation of women as journalists (Manning 2000; Allan, Branston, and Carter 2002). Research on this matter is based on the premise that women journalists will be more prone to interview women as sources, both because they are less embedded in journalism\u2019s dominant occupational ideology and because social proximity makes it easier for them to develop networks that include women\u00b4s voices (Armstrong 2004; Berkowitz 2009; Deuze 2008; Gans 1979; North 2016). One stream of research finds that stories by women and minority reporters are more likely to use women and minority sources (Armstrong 2004; Global Media Monitoring Project 2015; Zeldes and Fico 2005; Zeldes, Fico and Diddi 2007; Zoch and Turk 1998). However, other studies find that women journalists do not act differently as reporters and editors than their male counterparts (Freedman, Fico, and Love 2007; \u00de\u00f3rhallsd\u00f3ttir, 2014; Ross 2007; De Swert and Hooghe 2010). This stream of inquiry contends that gender discrimination in sourcing practices results from male and female reporters\u2019 shared newsroom socialization and news values (Aven, Parker, and McEvoy 1993; Rodgers and Thorson 2003).", "Differences in sourcing practices between men and women working as journalists have also been found to be related to credibility matters. Some scholars have shown that credibility ratings are higher for male journalists on dimensions such as competence, composure and extroversion, which results in female news workers being perceived as less authoritative (Brann and Himes 2010; Chernobrov 2018; Etling and Young 2007; Koziner 2018). This may lead to an overcompensation by female journalists to increase their authoritativeness. Research has indicated that professional women must exceed the standards of men in order to make up for the perception that they are less competent (Volz and Lee 2013). Scholars have called this the \u201ccompensation model\u201d: those belonging to disadvantaged groups neutralize that disadvantage by having more of the right characteristics than their counterparts (Black and Erickson 2000; Black and Erickson 2003; Volz and Lee 2013). The number and range of sources can be regarded as a \u201cproxy\u201d for news quality and provides legitimacy and authority to news articles by allowing journalists to present themselves as objective observers (Franklin and Carlson 2010; Tiffen et\u00a0al. 2014; Tuchman 1972).", "Finally, some studies on the presence of women\u2019s voices on digital media and social networks find that inequalities persist and even increase in these platforms (Armstrong and Gao 2011; Garcia, Weber, and Garimella 2014; Meeks 2014; Matias, Szalavitz, and Zuckerman 2017; Usher, Holcomb, and Littman 2018; Vliegenthart and Boukes, 2018). Von Nordheim and colleagues find that elite voices on Twitter were used as a source more often than nonelite users (Von Nordheim, Boczek and Koppers, 2018). Robinson and her colleagues argue that \u201cdigital inequalities can reinforce existing social inequalities and even exacerbate them because they carry over preexisting differences in human capital into online settings\u201d (2015, 570). This is partly due to differentials in digital skills between men and women (Padovani, Raeymaeckers, and De Vuyst 2019). On social media, men have more followers and are twice as likely to follow another man as they are to follow a woman, while women are 25% more likely to follow another woman (Heil and Piskorski 2009).1 In her analysis of tweets from United States\u2019 reporters, Artwick reveals that \u201cjust 11 percent of all the quotes cited women\u201d (2014, 1122). Regarding the social media expression of news sites, a prior study by the authors (2018) has found that news organizations tend to alter their agenda on social media by posting more frequently on \u201csofter\u201d topics. Thus, it is possible that the social media accounts of news organizations might feature a more balanced gender distribution of sources than their respective news sites.", "Informed by the existent scholarship, in this article we test three hypotheses and ask two research questions:", "H1.

The gap was also large for articles about business and politics, with differences of means of 0.93 and 0.70, respectively.

News about education and entertainment, by contrast, were positively correlated with an increase of women as sources. The regression also shows that stories with a feature-style format are positively and significantly related to the quantity of women as sources. H3 predicted that news bylined by women would include more women as sources.

Journalists of both genders cite more men and there is no statistical difference between the average of men as sources of stories bylined by men and women (Table 4).

Table 3 shows that only stories on La Naci\u00f3n were significantly, although marginally, more likely to mention women as sources than the other news organizations. This could be because La Naci\u00f3n publishes more articles with women bylines than the other news sites included in the sample: 13% of its news stories were authored by a woman, compared to an average of 6.21%.7 Thus, in a highly polarized media system, the eight news organizations studied converge in at least one thing: the lack of gender equality regarding which voices are quoted as sources in the articles through which they represent the main events in the life of the country.", "RQ2 inquires whether the number of women as sources varies according to whether the articles were published on the homepage or the social media accounts of the news outlets. The regression yields no significant differences in the number of women as sources when comparing the articles posted on the Facebook and Twitter accounts of a given news site with the articles most prominently displayed on its respective homepage (Table 3). Even though social media platforms are vehicles for self-expression and multi-directional communication across all sectors of the public, the eight news organizations studied largely reproduced their editorial choices for their respective websites on their linked Facebook and Twitter accounts. A comparison of the mean number of female and male sources in three conditions\u2014featured in articles posted (a) only on the homepage; (b) only on social media; and (c) on both digital venues\u2014shows that stories posted on social media only had an average of 0.35 women sources, compared to 0.42 for articles displayed prominently on the homepage.

While journalists of both genders cite more men, our account showed that a female byline is positively correlated to both women and men as sources.

Finally, the likelihood of having a woman as a source does not increase on articles posted on the social media accounts of news outlets: articles posted on social media had fewer sources, both male and female, than those displayed on the homepage.8", "The existing scholarship has argued that at least part of the sidelining of women\u00b4s voices could be mitigated by the inclusion of more female journalists, who would be more prone to contact sources of their own gender (Armstrong 2004; Zeldes and Fico 2005). Previous literature found that female bylines were a significant predictor of the usage of women as sources, but did not determine whether those results were driven by story type or topic (Armstrong 2004). This article expands this line of research by controlling for topic, day of the week, site, and digital venue. We have found that female bylines retain a positive influence on mentions of women as sources after controlling for these additional variables. Furthermore, gender imbalance in sourcing is present across all the news sites analyzed. Thus, gender bias seems to be a pervasive characteristic of the media system, even in the context of a highly polarized media system operating in a society increasingly demanding greater gender equality in all walks of life. Finally, the digital outlet on which articles are posted is not significantly associated with the presence of female sources. Therefore, gender imbalances in sourcing patterns transfer somewhat evenly from traditional media to websites to popular social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. This is despite existent research documenting a softening of the news agenda from news sites to social media platforms, thus creating a mix of topics in which traditionally female sources are more present. Technologies change but patterns of gender discrimination persist and are even reinforced online, as argued by Padovani, Raeymaeckers, and De Vuyst (2019).", "Scholars have argued that the disparity between female and male mentions as sources in media may stem from the scarcity of women in positions of power and media\u2019s reliance on official sources (Global Media Monitoring Project 2015; Shor et\u00a0al. 2015). Thus, part of our findings may be in part explained by this type of factors, as the gap is widest in stories about foreign affairs, business, and politics, where official sources are the most common (Fico and Freedman 2001; Hackett 1985; Jones 2007; Soley 1992). However, this is probably not the whole story for at least two reasons. First, during the past decade Latin America, according to the Global Media Monitoring Project, was \u201ca region leading in the percentage of countries with women as holders of the highest political office\u201d (2015, 33). Argentina had a particularly strong presence of women as political leaders, represented, among others, by current vice-president Gabriela Michetti; the governor of the largest and most populated province Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal; and former president and current senator Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. The disconnect between the positions occupied by women in Argentine politics and their comparatively lesser roles in the media mirrors the situation in Scandinavian countries which, although they are usually considered at the forefront of gender equality, inequalities regarding gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation, persist in the media and other industries (Edstr\u00f6m, Facht, and M\u00f8lster 2014; Robinson et\u00a0al. 2015).", "Second, female journalists\u2019 relatively more frequent use of women as sources allows us to infer that there might be other influences in source selection besides macro level factors: social proximity between female reporters and sources makes it easier to contact each other (Gans 1979). This finding is in line with Rodgers and Thorson\u2019s \u201cgender model\u201d (2003). Moreover, female journalists\u2019 overall use of more sources may be a way to increase their legitimacy and authority, since the amount and variety of sources can be regarded as a measure of quality reporting (Tiffen et\u00a0al. 2014; Tuchman 1972). These results suggest that increasing female representation in newsrooms may help increase the representation of women as sources and the use of sources in general. These findings also indicate that focusing on individual advancement from a liberal feminist perspective, such as more women being hired as reporters, might have societal consequences. More women journalists are related to an increase in the number of women cited in news across all topics, and could indirectly influence cultural representations of women and women\u2019s roles.", "The diversity of voices that takes part in news stories influences public discourse of important societal issues. Imbalanced gendered sourcing patterns reinforce women\u2019s lower status and further their exclusion from the public sphere. Increasing the representation of women as sources would broaden the range of voices heard in the media and promote a more equal society by expanding public perceptions of who is a suitable interlocutor for the press. Moreover, lack of diversity in sources means that news sites have so far failed to become an arena for the diverse set of ideas expected in a pluralistic democracy. While digital news media and social media platforms might be avenues for innovation, they exist within a social and political context that privileges men and their voices. Technological change, in and of itself, does not entail more opportunities for women and other minorities, at least regarding news sourcing: existing patterns of gender discrimination seem to have migrated online, thus maintaining and reinforcing hegemonic gender practices in the new media environment.", "Being quoted as a source provides visibility and an opportunity to shape news stories and, in consequence, perceptions of social reality. News sources have an effect on what gets prioritized and covered, and the way that coverage is done. Sources frame and define stances on issues, and if more men than women are carrying out the definition of problems and possible solutions, inequality is more likely to be reinforced rather than contested, thus continuing the cycle of invisibility of women and their issues. Gender imbalances in the allocation of representation opportunities both reproduce and strengthen disparities between men and women. However, discrimination of women as sources is not an intractable problem: news organizations could incorporate more female reporters, track their sources, and implement policies that encourage diversity of subjects in news stories. This study seeks to provide up-to-date evidence on patterns of gender imbalance as a step towards greater diversity and inclusion in the news and social media, and in society at large."]}, {"title": "Disclosure statement", "paragraphs": ["No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors."]}], "references": [{"title": "Las Periodistas Desde Los Estudios Del Periodismo: Perfiles Profesionales de Las Mujeres en Los Medios Informativos", "year": "2017", "journal": "Cuestiones de G\u00e9nero: de la Igualdad y la Diferencia", "volume": "12", "authors": [{"name": "Amado Adriana.", "first_name": "Amado", "last_name": "Adriana."}]}, {"title": "The Influence of Reporter Gender on Source Selection in Newspaper Stories", "year": "2004", "journal": "Journalism \\& Mass Communication Quarterly", "volume": "81", "authors": [{"name": "Armstrong Cory L.", "first_name": "Armstrong", "last_name": "L."}]}, {"title": "Story Genre Influences Whether Women Are Sources", "year": "2006", "journal": "Newspaper Research Journal", "volume": "27", "authors": [{"name": "Armstrong Cory L.", "first_name": "Armstrong", "last_name": "L."}]}, {"title": "Gender, Twitter and News Content: An Examination across Platforms and Coverage Areas", "year": "2011", "journal": "Journalism Studies", "volume": "12", "authors": [{"name": "Armstrong Cory L.", "first_name": "Armstrong", "last_name": "L."}, {"name": "Gao.
