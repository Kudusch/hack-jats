A content analysis of printed comments and interviews with journalists who choose them reveal how gatekeeping constructs a hybrid site of participatory journalism that is similar to but distinct from letters to the editor. Unlike letters, anonymity was the norm. Smaller newspapers predictably printed a larger percentage of comments. But publications of all sizes edited comments, sometimes heavily, before printing them. In selecting comments for newspapers, journalists juggle the immediacy and informality of online conversation with such print standards as context, civility, and readability.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Of the 286 online reader comments accompanying a 2011 article posted on The Washington Post website, eight were printed in the newspaper a few days later. What was special about those comments, which were submitted by such readers as \u201cDMV74\u201d and \u201cJamesOnThePotomac\u201d? Was it their length, perspective, or popularity with online readers? This study examines reader comments that were first posted in the freewheeling online environment and then herded into a coherent forum in print.", "Newspapers around the world, including The New York Times and the Herald Sun in Melbourne, Australia, regularly devote space to reader comments originally posted online. The selected comments are compiled in a forum with summaries of the articles that triggered the reader response. The forums are similar in presentation to letters to the editor, their cousins in discourse; in fact, they often appear on opinion pages. But unlike letter writers, the commenters did not seek to be published in print. It is the newspaper reader who is late to their conversation.", "While letters to the editor have long been scrutinized as vehicles for democratic participation and as products of gatekeeping practices, comment forums have received scant academic or industry attention. Yet they are newly positioned within the \u201cnormative-economic justification for public discourse\u201d that is assumed for letters to the editor (Wahl-Jorgensen 2002a, 121; Manosevitch and Walker 2009). As recently as 2002, scholars and journalists saw letters to the editor as key to a \u201crevival\u201d of the \u201cpublicness\u201d that newspapers hoped to promote (Wahl-Jorgensen 2002a, 122). Thus printed comments and letters share a theoretical context.", "This second life for comments is worth investigating as a merger of old and new media, representing an industry attempt to promote discourse while attracting the very readers assumed to have abandoned print. This study advances gatekeeping theory by outlining how journalists gather, organize, and edit these features in choosing which voices will surface from online, and whether that voice is truly preserved. It also provides a practical introduction to reader comment forums and the ways they are influenced by technology and circulation figures. It uses a content analysis of the printed comments as well as interviews with some journalists who select them to shed light on this intersection of Web and print newsroom practices."]}, {"title": "Background and Literature Review", "paragraphs": ["The Rocky Mountain News in Denver was a pioneering mainstream publication when it allowed readers to post comments on its online articles in 1998; by 2011, 92 percent of the top 150 newspapers allowed comments (Santana 2011). Their sheer number has been transformative. Each week The New York Times prints about 100 letters to the editor while its website publishes about 8000 comments (personal communication with Sasha Koren, a Times digital editor, March 16, 2012). In less than a decade, comments have become the \u201cmost frequent form of sustained written discourse\u201d in new media (Levinson 2009, 22). They help increase website traffic and build brand loyalty (Singer et al. 2011, 104).", "Comments have spurred researchers to investigate their anonymity (Rosenberry 2011; McCluskey and Hmielowski 2011), incivility (Loke 2011, 2012; Diakopoulos and Naaman 2011), and unruliness (Wahl-Jorgensen, Williams, and Wardle 2011), factors that the news media industry sees as comments\u2019 biggest drawback (Perez-Pena 2010; Kim 2009). Other studies explain how user-generated content disrupted and revolutionized traditional newsroom norms, values, and perceptions (Singer 2001, 2006, 2011; Singer and Ashman 2009; Nielsen 2012; Hermida and Thurman 2007, 2008; Rosenberry 2005; Santana 2011; Loke 2011; Robinson 2007).", "Journalists support comments but are troubled by their effect on their profession and remain skeptical of their usefulness (Nielsen 2012). Others consider comments as sources for reporting (Santana 2011; Singer and Ashman 2009; Abdul-Mageed 2008). Still, Paulussen and Ugille (2008) saw obstructions to participatory journalism, including user-generated content like comments. Research on public deliberation also found journalists unwilling to share their online space (Rebillard and Touboul 2010).", "However, Manosevitch and Walker (2009) found comments fulfilling a public deliberation role similar to letters to the editor. They called comments on Iowa news websites legitimate representatives of public deliberation because they \u201coffered substantial amount of factual information, and demonstrated a public process of weighing alternatives via the expression of issue positions and supporting rationales\u201d (21). They identified methods used by commenters to support their point of view, including \u201cnarratives\u201d of biographical information; \u201cfacts;\u201d \u201csources,\u201d which rely on links or authoritative sources; and \u201cvalues\u201d espousing a particular belief or point of view (12). Furthermore, in comparing comments with letters to the editor during the Jena Six controversy, McCluskey and Hmielowski (2011) concluded that comments presented a broader range of sentiment because they benefited from anonymity, less gatekeeping, and the technological ease of responding.", "In spite of attention to comments, the hurdles for getting letters published in newspapers still draw scrutiny in the twenty-first century (Perrin and Vaisey 2008; Raeymaeckers 2005; Wahl-Jorgensen 2002a, 2002b, 2006; Nord 2001). Letters have long been seen as important to the democratic and economic goals of newspapers by fostering public discourse while producing content that might attract readers (Wahl-Jorgensen 2002a). But participation traditionally was confined to a few handpicked letters (Nord 2001). While \u201ceditors proclaim the letters section a \u2018wide open forum,\u2019 they cannot deny their work as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 of public debate\u201d (Wahl-Jorgensen 2006, 222). For example, Thomas Feyer, the New York Times letters editor, receives \u201cseveral hundred\u201d letters a day, equaling \u201ca few thousand a week. Of these, we run about 10 to 12 a day, depending on space\u201d (personal communication, March 16, 2012).", "Letters editors wield power by selecting which letters and at which length, among other attributes, to publish (Kapoor 1995). They favor polished submissions (Kapoor 1995; Wahl-Jorgensen 2002b). In the San Francisco area, letters editors preferred the \u201cemotionally charged, personal stories of individuals\u201d (Wahl-Jorgensen 2001, 304). They usually reject anonymous submissions (Reader 2005; Wahl-Jorgensen 2001) though sometimes with ambivalence (Lauterer 2006). Incivility is weighed against the need for public debate (Wahl-Jorgensen 2004). Letter writers tend to be educated, wealthy, and over 40 (Reader, Stempel, and Daniel 2004). Comparing printed letters to those not published, researchers detected bias in the gatekeeping process of selection (Grey and Brown 1970; Renfro 1979; Butler and Schofield 2008).", "Comments, on the other hand, play key roles in participatory journalism (Reich 2011, 98): they are a spontaneous, informal, mostly anonymous public forum that has forwarded the \u201cevolution of participatory spaces\u201d and the \u201cresponsiveness of news\u201d in offering story-specific feedback. As a website fixture, they guarantee the \u201chybrid nature of online news.\u201d Reich also noted \u201ctheir great popularity\u201d and \u201cthe controversy they create.\u201d This study investigates whether online comments transferred to print retain their participatory functions: RQ1:\u2003What are the characteristics of printed comment forums, and how are they shaped by the publications that choose them? ", "What are the characteristics of printed comment forums, and how are they shaped by the publications that choose them?", "By passing basic tests of civility and decency, reader comments have cleared a primary hurdle (or gate) to get posted on news media websites. To be selected for print, comments face further scrutiny that is best explained through gatekeeping theory. The concept was first applied to journalism after White (1950) observed a wire editor, \u201cMr. Gates,\u201d sort through dispatches to determine which would appear in his paper. Gatekeeping has since explained how journalists select, report, and display their work even as subsequent research found newsroom practices less singular and more complex than Mr. Gates\u2019 habits and influenced by other factors, including newsroom norms; ownership; competition; official and corporate sources; and public sentiment (Shoemaker and Vos 2009; Shoemaker and Reese 1996; Reese and Ballinger 2001; Cassidy 2006).", "The flood of reader-generated content and its interaction with journalists, along with the curator role they now play, led to reconsiderations of gatekeeping as gatewatching (Bruns 2005) or as a gateway (Robinson 2006). The rise of internet interactivity, in particular readers\u2019 increased participation in political coverage beyond polling, suggests that journalists \u201cmay be taking steps toward reshaping their gatekeeping role\u201d and \u201cstepping back from the gate\u201d (Singer 2006, 265). In fact, journalists \u201cwho have long defined themselves largely as society's gatekeepers now find that the role is broadly shared with members of an increasingly active audience\u201d (Singer 2011, 22).", "The early days of online journalism found little need for gatekeeping of news articles even as reader comments were subjected to gatekeeping controls to curb incivility (Singer 2001). Later, British journalists insisted on retaining their gatekeeping role while simultaneously encouraging expanded engagement online (Hermida and Thurman 2007, 2008). Latin American news websites seek little reader interaction (Bachmann and Harlow 2012). American publications are equally intent on maintaining some gatekeeping responsibilities even with \u201clegally and ethically responsible user-generated content\u201d but at least consider input from their audiences (Singer 2011, 20). Even news sites heralding user-generated content limit its journalistic participation (Domingo et al. 2008; Harrison 2010). Journalists highlight audience content that reflects values more associated with their profession, like balance and fairness, than with the consumers contributing them (Reader 2007). In essence, journalists are \u201cguarding open gates\u201d in participatory journalism (Singer et al. 2011).", "Because printed comments can be compared with their original online text without newsroom consent, this study takes advantage of the transparency to see how printed reader comments differ from their original posting: RQ2:\u2003How are printed comments different from their online version? ", "How are printed comments different from their online version?", "Researchers continue to find contrasting newsroom norms and practices at large and small newspapers, the latter having better withstood the devastating industry declines (Lewis, Kaufhold, and Lasorsa 2010; Lauterer 2006). Smaller publications are more responsive to their communities by emphasizing local news, events, and people\u2014from the front to the back of the paper (Lauterer 2006; Funk 2010). \u201cThe small-town newspaper has a smaller pool of events from which to choose in writing news items, making its gates easier to pass\u201d (Shoemaker and Vos 2009, 24). In ethical decision-making, \u201cdirect accountability to the community is the biggest difference\u201d between big- and small-paper editors (Reader 2006, 859).", "Smaller newspapers also face different gatekeeping responsibilities with letters to the editor. About 49 percent of small newspapers shorten letters, while 90 percent of larger papers do so (Kapoor 1995). They are obliged to be more responsive to their public and run more letters (Wahl-Jorgensen 2006; Lauterer 2006).", "The differences extend online. Nielsen (2012) noted that journalists at small newspapers reported the highest frequency of reading comments, and were slightly more likely than their bigger-circulation counterpoints to find reader comments constructive. Gilligan (2011), in analyzing how mediated participation from afar might change a smaller publication's power dynamics, noted that many community newspapers have adopted Facebook and Twitter: \u201cIn the near future, social media such as Facebook may become one of community newspapers\u2019 most important friends\u201d (66).

In particular, journalists who choose letters to the editor can articulate their gatekeeping responsibilities as well as the newsroom burdens they face (Wahl-Jorgensen 2002a, 2006; Raeymaeckers 2005; Nord 2001). Some say that the task of getting letters into \u201cpublishable shape can be one of the toughest jobs in the newsroom\u201d because they \u201cstruggle to preserve the personal voice and the substance of the letter, seeing it as their role \u2018manage the debate, rather than censor it\u2019\u201d (Wahl-Jorgensen 2006, 223).

Three worked at larger-circulation papers. The journalists, two print editors and two web producers, called reader engagement the primary mission of their forums. While each offered individual reasons for selecting comments, common themes included an ease in editing comments, the challenge of selecting replies, and a refusal to label their selections as an elite class of comment.", "In a typical response, Journalist \u201cA\u201d called the forums part of a commitment \u201cto give more of a voice to our readers,\u201d wording mirrored by others.

None said that online identification, like a photograph, improved a commenter's chance of being chosen for print. A journalist at a smaller paper praised Facebook for attracting readers: \u201cWe use Facebook because it is engaging. It's the best avenue for us to communicate with our readers.\u201d A journalist at a larger publication relied on reader and editor recommendations to sort through comments.", "Only \u201cA\u201d had received audience feedback about the forums, explaining that print readers were \u201cmixed\u201d in their reaction to an expanded reader section, while online readers seemed \u201cto like it, for the most part.\u201d \u201cB\u201d said that commenters \u201cdon't know and don't care\u201d about appearing in the newspaper but once had been thanked by a reader for correcting in print an error he had made online. \u201cB\u201d added that reporters liked having their articles in the forum."]}, {"title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of this study is to introduce and analyze online reader comments that are printed in newspapers. The findings reveal a legitimate yet highly orchestrated site of participatory journalism. They show how gatekeeping does not operate along a set of fixed conditions when online content makes its way into newsprint.", "In some ways, comment forums have heeded the call \u201cto hear the silent, clumsy and messy citizens\u201d that letters editors should seek out (Wahl-Jorgensen 2002b, 78). A distinguishing characteristic is their scant concern over anonymity, a roadblock to publishing unsigned letters to the editor (Reader 2005; Kapoor 1995). In fact, each publication set its own policy on reader identification. As Shoemaker and Vos point out, \u201ctoday's individual gatekeeping decision may become tomorrow's selection norm\u201d (2009, 52). That one- or two-word remarks constitute suitable newspaper content further proves that the forums offer a wider rhetorical range than letters to the editor. Athens, Bluefield, and Meadville, each with circulations under 25,000, not only used Facebook to invite conversation on articles and less news-driven events\u2014\u201cWhat was your best Valentine's Day surprise ever?\u201d\u2014but also published at least half of those responses, regardless of length or tone. This finding confirms the importance of local accountability for community publications, no matter the platform.", "But small and large papers used gatekeeping to herd online comments into what they considered print-ready shape. Lost in the process are spontaneity and controversy, two noteworthy characteristics of comments (Reich 2011). Many papers, following the practice with letters to the editor, trim comments. Even with scores or hundreds of choices at its disposal, The Washington Post edited 91 percent of its printed comments. Even though 30 percent of all the analyzed printed comments received significant editing (addition or deletion of phrases or sentences), journalists called the task \u201cnormal\u201d editing. Through such editing, comments that were unfocused, mean-spirited, or grammatically challenged\u2014like those following Whitney Houston's death\u2014can be sanitized to blend in any discussion.", "Publications also guard the gate against digressions and dialogues among commenters, even those chosen for comment forums. In addition, the printed comments usually are not published in the order they had been posted online.", "This study's findings also reveal an old issue given a new media twist: should comments, like quotations, be polished before appearing in print? Publications should be mindful of whether to allow misspellings, or rephrase or clarify text. A comment published in the Austin paper, which does not fix grammar, would read differently in Washington. Publications might consider alerting readers that the comment forums have been edited for length, context, etc., as they do with letters. The concern here is equally for the online commenter and the print reader, who may be misled by an editor's deft touch. One limitation of this study is that it did not compare all of the printed comments with the entirety of their online discussion. Further research should analyze whether the sentiment of online conversations emerge intact in comment forums. Not only could a contentious or off-topic online thread be cherry-picked for print to portray reason and civility, but also an online discussion might overwhelmingly express one point of view, while the chosen comments emphasize another. In one instance, an Austin blog post on excessive police force attracted 15 comments voicing anti-police sentiment, three defending the police, three that were mixed while telling personal anecdotes, and seven engaged in a digression about parenting. The paper printed two biographical comments expressing both sides of the issue. This study urges more gatekeeping research that takes advantage of online transparency to make these comparisons.", "It is worth investigating whether commenters are aware of being published in print and how it affects their view of the newspaper; conversely, what do print readers think of online conversations repackaged as content? Another question is whether these forums can match the durability of letters to the editor.", "This study of printed reader comments highlights the limitation and promise of audience participation across platforms. It shows that publications that publish comment forums juggle the immediacy and informality of online conversation with such print standards as context, civility, and readability. If journalism is indeed \u201cnow a dialogue rather than a monologue\u201d (Robinson 2006, 22), the gatekeeping of printed comments reveals how this conversation with readers is being transcribed and translated into print."]}], "references": [{"title": "Online News Sites and Journalism 2.0: Reader Comments on Al-Jazeera Arabic", "year": "2008", "journal": "Cognition, Communication, Co-operation", "volume": "6", "authors": [{"name": "Abdul-Mageed Muhammad.
