Journalism needs a new set of ethics to deal with this ecological crisis.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Journalists luxuriate in the rapid and profound research, communication, and publication guaranteed by new media technologies. Of course, numerous well-known drawbacks accompany such benefits. Instantaneity can breed error and embarrassment as quickly and easily as accuracy and accolades, while the overproduction of news can endanger the professional autonomy and security of journalists and overload them with multiskilling, as cycles of reportage obey the rhythms of capital rather than conscience.", "But there is another, life-threatening, earth-endangering aspect to digital journalism that all too often eludes such debate: the environmental impact of news. I lay that out here, then look at corporate, activist, and scholarly responses to the crisis.", "The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) (2008, 2009, 2012, 2014) predicts that communication technologies will connect all 6.5 billion residents of the Earth by the close of 2015, enabling everyone to \u201caccess information, create information, use information and share information.\u201d This development could even \u201ctake the world out of financial crisis,\u201d principally thanks to developing markets. But the ITU is wise enough to say that these technologies may also cause grave environmental problems, so it presses for \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d and greater efficiency in energy use. In that spirit, the 2008 World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly in South Africa urged members to reduce the carbon footprint of communication, in accord with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Tour\u00e9 2008).", "There are lessons here for journalism in the digital age. They connect to a lengthy history of environmental despoliation that is rarely referenced in J-School, in media studies, or in newsrooms.1 Since the development of print and on to the days of mobile telephony, the technologies used by writers and publishers have drawn upon, created, and emitted dangerous substances, generating multi-generational risks for ecosystems and employees alike. Many of these risks are invisible to journalism, because they are separated from the labor process that disseminates news output in newsrooms and other reporting sites, or they occur at different stages of the life cycle of the media technologies that journalists deploy.", "An alternative account of journalism is required that centers ecology at the heart of the profession. This requires a horizontal as well as a vertical historiography in order to look at the entire material history of the commodity sign called journalism.", "Such a history begins with the systematic deforestation, conflict mining, perilous extraction, and unsustainable industrialization that characterize obtaining the raw materials of journalism, from paper, over the last two centuries, to cell phones, over the last two decades. The next phase, manufacturing, leaves its own destructive trace. Print labor has long contended with poisonous solvents, inks, fumes, dust, and tainted wastewater. Telegraphy and telephony involved the first major commercial applications of electricity, through batteries. Then as now, battery workers were exposed to lead and other pathogens that damage the lungs, skin, and nervous system. Today, people manufacturing these and other media technologies, from television sets to printers to cell phones to laptops to tablets, run the risk of brain, liver, kidney, and stomach cancers (Maxwell and Miller 2012).", "We move forward next to the impact of these gadgets when they are in operation. More than 10 billion communications devices around the world need electricity. They are responsible for about 15 percent of the world\u2019s residential energy use. Without a change to that trend, the proportion will rise to 30 percent of global residential consumption by 2022, and 45 percent by 2030. Most of these gadgets derive their power sources from fossil fuel-driven electricity, and the rechargeable batteries of mobile technologies have energy costs as part of their production, usage, and disposal (International Energy Agency 2009).", "Let\u2019s consider for a moment the seemingly simple question of the cell phone, a staple of the journalistic craft that is often in use\u2014but frequently left in semi-repose and still turned on. The International Energy Agency estimates that 400 terawatt hours per year are wasted in this way each year. That figure is equivalent to \u201cthe annual electricity generated by 133 mid-size coal-fired power plants (500 megawatts each), each requiring 1.4 million tonnes of coal per year\u201d (International Energy Agency 2014).", "Then there is the electricity used in every on-line search and exchange of information. Most searches are probably coal-powered, though their energy sources are as hard to pin down as the packet system itself. We do know that Google\u2019s 2011 carbon footprint was almost equal to that of Laos or the United Nations Organization, largely due to running its search engines (Clark 2011).2", "Problems also arise when digital journalism is received by the public. New technologies of reading are often assumed to be greener than print because they do not involve deforestation. Paper and pulp are the United States\u2019s leading commercial users of water, the fourth biggest emitters of toxins into waterways, and the third largest industrial consumers\u00a0of energy, making them the third worst emitters of greenhouse gases; and we can add to this the toxic problems of dumping paper waste into landfills, carbon emissions from the transportation of printed material, and a reliance on monoculture plantation forestry (Planet Ark 2008).", "But there is no accepted measurement system for readers, publishers, scholars, policy makers, librarians, and salespeople to calculate the renewable virtues of paper versus the electrical vices of electronics (Maxwell and Miller 2012).3 Paper producers increased recycling from 5 percent of all fiber in 2004 to 24 percent in 2010, reduced carbon emissions by 25 percent between 2006 and 2010, and save five million trees annually. They argue that youthful trees absorb carbon more readily than venerable ones, and digital publishing does nothing to remove carbon from the atmosphere (Book Environmental Council and Green Publishing Initiative 2013).", "Let\u2019s make the comparisons sharper: the average e-reader uses 33 pounds of minerals; a paper book uses two-thirds of a pound. The respective corollary figures in related fields are: 79 gallons of water versus two gallons and a hundred kilowatt hours of fossil fuels versus two hours, with proportional emissions of carbon dioxide. Also the amount of time per day that electricity is used for digital reading, especially via the power grid, must be factored into determining environmental impacts. Current research indicates that reading online for half an hour equates to 90 minutes of watching television or the printing of a newspaper (Maxwell and Miller 2012).", "Finally, when old and obsolete digital technologies are discarded, they become electronic or e-waste, which is the fastest-growing component of municipal cleanups around the Global North. E-waste generates serious threats to workers\u2019 and residents\u2019 health and safety wherever plastics and wires are burnt, monitors smashed and dismantled, and circuit boards grilled or leached with acid, while the toxic chemicals, noxious gases, and heavy metals that flow from such practices have perilous implications for people, soil, and water both locally and downstream. Epidemiologists and other health scholars have shown that e-waste recyclers in the informal economy, ragpickers, suffer an historically unprecedented prevalence of low hemoglobin, high monocyte and eosinophil counts, gum disease, diarrhea, and dermatitis. Extraordinary levels of psychological distress are also reported, and many states seek to outlaw them (Devi, Swamy, and Krishna 2014; Premalatha et al. 2014; Reis de Oliveira, Bernardes, and Gerbase 2012).", "Even though these facts are readily available via policy reports, scientific publications, and civil society groups, the love affair of the general public and media professionals with our deadly digital devices and problematic processes continues: expenditure on information technology reached US$3.7 trillion in 2013 (Brown 2013).", "Consider the latest exciting blind date\u2014with big data. Everybody\u2019s banging on about it these days, from the\u00a0Guardian\u2019s Sustainable Business podcast (http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/big-data-sustainability-podcast) to the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0(Harford 2014) to AT&T (Neff 2014). True believers see the potential for adding value to research and investigative journalism as a saving grace of technological change for those with the right skills to participate, thereby offsetting the negative impacts of job losses (Mair et al. 2013). These information society chorines, many of them journalists, rejoice that a full 90 percent of all currently existing data was created between 2012 and 2013 alone (Hsu 2013; Ramanathan 2013; SINTEF 2013). So much for Austen, Foucault, and Confucius.\u00a0Le Monde\u00a0has declared this the moment \u201cWhen Mathematicians Became Sexy\u201d\u2014surely the most bathetic Romance-language headline of 2013 (Durut 2013).", "Beyond the hum of faith healing and oil-skin sales, some critical questions are being posed, such as whether big data will truly make governments and firms more alert to the public interest and whether it will undermine privacy. But what about how its energy use will affect the environment? This question is basically unasked by journalists and their wannabe and lapsed equivalents in universities."]}, {"title": "Sustainable Journalism", "paragraphs": ["Much of the problem lies with the perhaps accidental invisibility of these issues, which I mentioned earlier. But there is also a willful obfuscation. Consider that seemingly benign metaphor: \u201cthe cloud.\u201d It signifies the place where all good software goes for rest and recuperation, emerging on demand, refreshed and ready to spring into action. Seemingly ephemeral and natural\u2014clouds are necessities of life that rain on us then go away\u2014these are actually coal-fired server farms and data centers. The US National Mining Association and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity gleefully avow that the \u201cCloud Begins with Coal\u201d (Mills 2013). They note that the world\u2019s communication technologies use 1500 terawatt hours each year\u2014equivalent to Japan and Germany\u2019s overall energy use combined, and 50 percent more than the aviation industry. That amounts to 10 percent of global electricity. The Association and the Coalition even quote poor old Greenpeace (2012) on the negative environmental implications of data centers, as evidence of future growth for the extractive industries.", "Here is a classic case of the sign exceeding its referent while being hugely obscured by it. Compare this to the visible, concrete, and public equivalents of an earlier era: telephone exchanges, post offices, and power stations\u2014the materiality of a popular if implicit socialism.", "A second instance of metaphorical obfuscation occurs when sustainability and journalism are linked syntagmatically. In the Global North, the profession is running scared, as proprietors: cut costs; interlace entertainment, advertising, sports, and news; lose their commitment to the public interest; turn covetous eyes to opportunity cost\u2019s alternative valuations; and behave abominably to their workers. Journalists are joining a rapidly expanding cognitariat (Miller 2013). The way that marginal cultural labor, from the jazz musician to the street artist, has long survived\u00a0sans\u00a0regular compensation and security now models the expectations we are\u00a0all\u00a0supposed to have, displacing our parents\u2019 or grandparents\u2019 assumptions about steady employment. Hence the success of concerns such as Mindworks Global Media, a company outside New Delhi whose Indian-based digital journalists and copyeditors work long-distance for newspapers with reporters supposedly located in the United States and Europe, with 35\u201340 percent cost savings (http://www.mindworksglobal.com/); or the US advertising agency Poptent, which undercuts big competitors in sales to major clients by exploiting quasi-amateur labor in the name of \u201cempowerment.\u201d That empowerment takes the following form: Poptent pays the creators of homemade commercials US$7500. It receives a management fee of US$40,000 and the buyer saves US$300,000 on the usual price (http://www.poptent.com/creativenetwork).", "Many journalists are even complicit with these environmental and occupational hazards. Consider Schumpeterian celebrants of this new era, which supposedly clears out decadent, incompetent media companies (Brock [2013] is a stereotypical example); earnest seekers after new business models (Braiker 2014); or coin-operated managers engorging themselves in capitalist self-congratulation (D\u2019Vorkin 2012). The cheerleaders are as numerous as the redundancies they blissfully ignore. In 2013, the late David Carr, chief confessor of the New York Times and its principal technology booster, wrote this advice to young anglo-parlante journalists:Right now, being a reporter is a golden age. There may be a lack of business models to back it up, but having AKTOCA on\u2014All Known Thought One Click Away\u2014on my desktop, tablet or phone makes it an immensely deeper, richer exercise than it used to be.
