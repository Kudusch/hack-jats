Sandberg opens her book with a story about her pregnancy while working at Google and uses the book as a venue for bringing attention to \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d in the workplace. As Sandberg writes: \u201cTo this day, I\u2019m embarrassed that I didn\u2019t realize that pregnant women needed reserved parking until I experienced my own aching feet\u201d (Sandberg 2013, 4). Sandberg goes on to write throughout the project about how female leaders should, as one chapter indicates, \u201csit at the table\u201d of corporate leadership, find mentors to guide women through a career pattern that is more a child\u2019s \u201cjungle gym\u201d than a professional \u201cladder,\u201d and that \u201cthe single most important career decision that a woman makes is whether she will have a life partner and who that partner is\u201d (110).", "Arguably, interest in workplace equality and feminism in some professional groups has emerged from Sandberg\u2019s wake, though her approach has been interpreted as a \u201cmaternal-feminine\u201d (McRobbie 2013) one that tends to identify women involved in the \u201cLean In\u201d movement as \u201cslim, youthful-looking, and specifically middle-class mother[s]\u201d who are equals in their marriages and perform a decision-making function within their families (Steiner and Lachover 2016, 872). More specifically, bell hooks (2013) refers to professional rhetoric about the \u201cLean In\u201d movement\u2014a form of speech which this paper refers to as \u201cindustry speak\u201d\u2014as being a \u201csimplistic description of the feminist movement based on women gaining equal rights to men.\u201d In short, feminist scholars widely argue that recent industry speak about women and leadership in the workplace ignores complications of race and class at work\u2014and at \u201chome\u201d\u2014by highlighting binary systems of sex and gender identification, gendered social roles and practices, and advocates\u2014even indirectly\u2014hegemonic masculinity (Holmes 2006; Mullany 2007).", "Still, the \u201cLean In\u201d movement\u2014which suggests women must actively engage as leaders in their places of work (as though women are not disposed to such efforts)\u2014focuses on gains of women in the workplace. This approach is especially salient in communications fields where companies identify issues of gender inclusivity as measuring progress in diversification. The American Society of News Editors (2015), for instance, states that women hold 35 percent of supervisory positions in US newsrooms, while at the nation\u2019s 10 most widely circulated newspapers, women penned 37 percent of bylines, while men were found to have written nearly 60 percent of content. Women in the public relations field hold 75 percent of all positions, but only 20 percent of leadership roles (Women\u2019s Media Center 2014). Furthermore, research indicates that such inequalities influence hegemonic perceptions of gender in the workplace (for more, see Byerly 2013). How corporate communicators in media fields discuss issues of gender divides and the role of women in the workplace provide perspectives on how gender roles are distributed to wider audiences through media production (Franks and O\u2019Neill 2016; Zayer and Coleman 2015).", "A center focused on women in communication at our university welcomes communication experts from across the United States to speak about issues of diversity and leadership to college student audiences.1 These professionals range from those at legacy news media outlets to public relations and advertising firms, from print publications to television news companies. Each guest comes with an expressed intention to help young women become leaders in their careers and to address inequalities in the workforce\u2014and within the workplace. Yet, as observers of these discussions, we have been drawn to language and discourse within professionalized notions of binary gender roles and representations, which are often at the center of these discussions; namely that women must \u201cengage\u201d in the workplace and \u201cbalance\u201d motherhood and career. In 2017, such phrases appeared in a widely shared, 10-page manifesto by an employee at Google who described workplace differences between employees to be biological; the employee was later fired (McGirt 2017). Such rhetoric has contributed, to varying degrees, not only to how professionals treat one another, but also to how aspiring professionals view themselves and each other as part of society and as members of a workforce (Tindall and Waters 2017).", "While we understand that words of advice are intended to assist young professionals to recognize and adapt to professional expectations and environments, we argue that such rhetoric fuels a \u201cLean In\u201d movement in that its binary approach largely fails to acknowledge the role of men in unlearning or initiating change in organizational policies that restrict non-white and economically diverse members from the workplace (Gill 2016; Simon and Hoyt 2013). Nor do these notions of \u201cleaning in\u201d within career advice, we argue, operate to resist or challenge deeper cultural meanings of intersectionality in discussing the complications of work. This paper, therefore, examines language within talks given by 12 speakers at a Southern university\u2019s center on women in communication between 2013 and 2015 to reveal the influence of hegemonic masculinity in industry speak about women and professionalism in the fields of journalism, advertising, and public relations.2", "Through a feminist critique of discussions about \u201cwork\u2013life balance,\u201d \u201cleaning in,\u201d \u201cemotion,\u201d and the role of technology and innovation in women\u2019s careers, we argue that inherent in these discussions about media professionalism is discourse that perpetuates binary notions of feminine\u2013masculine traits of the workplace and that fails to account for notions of intersectionality (McCall 2005; Nash 2008). Rather than providing a normative assessment of the collected data, however, this paper attempts to explain common themes among the lectures in order to unveil the embedded ideologies of masculinity within the US media workplace. The article begins with a briefing on the status of women in the US media workplace. Next, we examine rhetoric related to women, leadership style, and professionalism before complicating hegemonic discussions about women in communication through the notions of intersectionality and hegemonic masculinity. The remainder of the paper explicates three major themes of industry speak that emerged from the speakers at the center of this study and that are representative of overarching narratives of women\u2019s personal and professional identities, work and leadership styles, and \u201cempowerment\u201d through gendered discussions of \u201cwork\u2013life balance.\u201d"]}, {"title": "Identifying Ideologies Within \u201cIndustry Speak\u201d", "paragraphs": ["Scholarship has identified specific language that appears in recent industry speak related to women in the workforce that celebrates the rise of women in leadership positions (Baxter 2010). Terms such as \u201cwork\u2013life balance,\u201d \u201cleaning in,\u201d and dealing with \u201cemotion\u201d have been ascribed to professional female \u201crising stars\u201d in ways that feature the individual\u2019s ability to overcome gender stereotypes and associated perceived challenges, such as \u201cmotherhood,\u201d while diminishing one\u2019s unique and layered identities beyond \u201cwomanhood\u201d (Coates 2004; Stainback, Kleiner, and Skaggs 2016). To further complicate meanings of gendered industry speak, this study examines a dozen hours of lectures given by 12 communication professionals who identified as women and that were recorded at a center for women in communication at a large Southern US university. Each speaker had been invited by the center (not the authors of this study) to share insights with college students about career advancement, leadership, and professionalism between May 2013 and October 2015 (Table 1).3 While invited speakers included university professors, each had had extensive professional experience in communications industries. \u201cNobody Really Wants to be Called Bossy or Domineering\u201dFeminist critique of media \u201cindustry speak\u201dAll authorsSamiyyah Black, Carolina Estrada, Mirza Carolina de la Fuente, Ashley Orozco, Andrew Trabazo, Sofia de la Vega & Robert E.

Individually and as a team, researchers read the transcripts multiple times, applying a grounded approach (Lobo et al. 2017) to identify conceptual themes of meaning. Edell, Brown, and Montano (2016) applied a similar qualitative approach to the stories told to them by young women who participated in an intergenerational organization designed to engage youth in \u201cgirl-driven\u201d activism. In that work, the researchers applied a reflexive approach to the research to create thematic meanings of the girls\u2019 stories that revealed complicated ideological layers within leaders\u2019 comments about leadership and mentorship of the girls. Edell, Brown, and Montano relied on the stories of the young women themselves to further explicate aspects of intersectionality within the group in terms of race, class, and age. Examining layers of meaning of language and processes of identification within human organizations reveals characteristics of power, subordination, and agency that complicate notions of work preparation, activism, and organizational behavior beyond normative understandings (Luna 2016; McRobbie 2013).", "To position ourselves within this project, our team of researchers included six undergraduate students, one graduate student, and one faculty member, with each team member bringing to the analysis varying degrees of experience in the professional workforce and each coming from a diverse set of identities and backgrounds. Together, the researchers transcribed and analyzed the speakers\u2019 commentary to identify commonalities in industry speak related to career advice directed toward young women. Through our discussions, we became interested in speakers\u2019 advice about organizational behavior and career preparation that appeared to negate the effects of hegemonic masculinity in the workplace while supporting paternalistic ideologies about the ability of women to reach levels of professional power by \u201cleaning in\u201d through hard work.", "Related research suggests that US-based workplaces tend to endorse hegemonically assigned leadership qualities and behavior perceived to be either highly masculine (i.e. labored, assertive, collaborative) or highly feminine (i.e. competitive, nurturing, creative), with little acknowledgment of individuals\u2019 layered identities beyond those of gender and sex (McCall 2005).4 Research on US workplaces, including those in communications fields, suggest that masculine traits tend to be connected to employment and promotion, while hegemonically identified and defined feminine traits are associated with maintaining stable and comfortable work environments that allow for their male colleagues to achieve (Connell and Messerschmidt 2005). Research on hegemonic masculinity at work also indicates that both men and women form and normalize related environments and practices, though may do so, in part, to survive negative outcomes from combating the status quo (Connell 1995). Therefore, scholars argue that future research must complicate sex or gender definitions as they may appear within workplace conflicts emerging from competing \u201cdesires and emotions\u201d and \u201ccosts and benefits of different gender strategies\u201d (Connell and Messerschmidt 2005, 852).", "To this end, the researchers of this study met for several hours each week over the period of three months to discuss the speakers\u2019 stories about their careers and work experiences. So as to reveal the \u201ccomplexity of social life\u201d (McCall 2005, 1772) embedded within speakers\u2019 comments and to position ourselves within this research project, we reflected upon our interpretations of career advice given, their stories of work, and the potential and multiple meanings culled from the speakers as a single narrative. In turn, we provide an analysis of gendered industry speak as a strategy of and for circumventing attacks upon masculine power dynamics within messages of \u201cleaning in\u201d (Nash 2008)."]}, {"title": "Women and Professional Traits in Communication Work and Training", "paragraphs": ["Women continually hold a percentage of representation as employees within communication fields, but not in leadership roles (Creedon and Cramer 2007). In the news business, for instance, some 35 percent of supervisory positions are held by women (American Society of News Editors 2015), while at the nation\u2019s 10 most widely circulated newspapers, 37 percent of articles, one study indicates, were written by women, while that online, men wrote 58 percent of content at major news outlets (Women\u2019s Media Center 2015). In advertising, according to another study, 10 percent of senior creative managers are women and hold nearly 40 percent of senior management positions (Kopenhaver Center 2015). Yet, within the diverse field of communications, which often is criticized for its lack of racial diversity, scholars tend to examine issues of representation rather than positions of power in management and content creation that appear in workplaces that lack a more critical analysis of the workplace\u2014and the identities of those within it (Armstrong 2013a; Byerly 2013; Poindexter, Meraz, and Weiss 2008). One study of female African American television journalists, for instance, reported that female professionals provided to their newsrooms an interest in covering Black communities, but that they did not express the same interest in altering journalistic practices or news constructions to reflect gender or race differences in interpreting the news (Meyers and Gayle 2015). That study, we note, is a rare occasion when research in this field attempts to complicate the role of identity in a professional setting that extends beyond a single form, such as gender, sex, age, or race.", "Certainly, and as Armstrong (2013b) writes, research that focuses only on male\u2013female binaries, a common approach to examining workforces within communications fields, operates amid a framework that ignores the complexities of influences and subjectivities inherent in individual and collective experiences; and it is within professional discourse about workplace environments\u2014and the workforce itself\u2014that this paper is concerned. In the United States, \u201cindustry speak,\u201d what we refer to in this paper as language about a workplace and a profession that is shaped by leaders of a field or industry, frames positive characteristics of its workers in a male\u2013female dichotomy (Fredrickson 2015). In this way, characteristics of \u201csuccessful\u201d men\u2014those perceived as strong, ambitious, determined, dominant\u2014are used as a benchmark of positive traits. When applied to women in the workplace, however, literature suggests that they result in alternative labels, such as a woman being \u201cbitchy,\u201d \u201cdemanding,\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d (Simon and Hoyt 2013).", "When The New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson resigned from the newspaper in 2013, for example, press and public discourses focused on rumor and innuendo surrounding her workplace management style, which was largely branded as cold and aggressive\u2014anything but \u201cfeminine.\u201d Even before Abramson was slated to take the newspaper\u2019s helm in 2011, trade and popular press publications focused on questions of how women may operate differently than men in the workplace. One American Journalism Review article in April of that year\u2014headlined \u201cDo Women Lead Differently?\u201d (Ricchiardi 2011)\u2014addressed the question through interviews with industry thought leaders, both male and female, and concluded that despite a clear answer on whether women do indeed \u201clead differently,\u201d The New York Times was to be praised for hiring its first female editor. Still, the firing led to questions about whether putting the onus on women to lean in is a solution to workplace discrimination and whether the media work environment is more complicated than male\u2013female dynamics (Geier 2017).", "The educational setting is an interesting one within which to examine discourse related to career preparation based on identity. One college textbook from 2014 that deals with gender and communication, for example, describes the \u201cLean In\u201d movement as one that helps explain that frequently \u201cwomen with excellent credentials fail to put themselves forward, while men whose qualifications are not so stellar do so without hesitation\u201d (Gamble and Gamble 2014, 333). The book summarizes Sandberg\u2019s aims with the movement to have men \u201cstrive harder\u201d at work and at home to create equity but also for women \u201cto stop sabotaging themselves by leaving the workforce before they actually leave\u201d (Sandberg 2013, 333), presumably to have children.", "In turn, we analyze major themes in our guest speakers\u2019 talks about how women should prepare for a career in communication, the challenges they might face, and the role of identity in their professional and personal lives. While this is not a comparison between how these speakers may provide career advice to men, we have found interest in the strikingly similar manner with which the speakers defined the professional workplace along lines of gender identity. Furthermore, we were struck by the nearly non-existent mention, as this analysis shows, of non-heteronormative definitions of identity and the possibility (and realities) of diverse workplaces and personal identifications beyond that of male\u2013female\u2014and for that matter complications of race, class, disability, and other forms of identification that would make for a more inclusive (and accurate) discussion of society."]}, {"title": "The Peak of Post-feminism: Women as \u201cDo It All\u201d Media Leaders", "paragraphs": ["We were especially struck by a consistency among how guest speakers defined the ideal professional who also identifies as being female.5 By and large, speakers presented a landscape for how women should prepare for the communications workforce, specifically by becoming a \u201cdo it all\u201d woman who can and will balance career with family (including having children of their own), while maintaining a sense of individualism within the workplace. A focus on creating a nuclear family\u2014or at the very least recognition within society that women may be expected to create a family while progressing through the ranks of supervisory positions within the workplace\u2014was positioned to overcome the challenges of working within a hegemonically masculine environment (McRobbie 2004). Moreover, this approach that women must not only engage in work but in heteronormative notions of family\u2014a condition of \u201cpopular postfeminism\u201d\u2014has also placed women as key for overcoming inequality across the workforce in addition to creating their own career success (Lazar 2011).", "These notions of \u201cdoing it all\u201d resonate with hyper-masculine elements of work (i.e. Rohde-Abuba 2016) that when adopted by women result in negative characterizations of one\u2019s identity, speakers said. Speaker 2, for example, who is a professor of advertising and public relations, identified that \u201cpervasive gender stereotypes that characterize leadership as a male trait that we are still struggling with in our society, that we haven\u2019t really moved past.\u201d Specifically, the speaker noted that \u201cwomen who are in leadership positions are often labeled as demanding, bossy, domineering, arrogant, emotional, self-promoting\u201d and that new professionals will need to first identify the normalization of this environment.", "In total, speakers\u2019 comments lacked dimensions of intersectionality of identity and social environments by focusing on a main theme of the workplace as being a female\u2013male space, a binary that limits discussion about the complexities of social interaction. We do not disagree that women\u2014and many women at that\u2014experience discrimination and harassment in the workplace based on identity, sex, and gender politics. In fact, we identify in this study the commonalities of speakers\u2019 reference to a workplace binary of male\u2013female without explicit reference to the hegemonic function of such limited description. Such an example appears in Speaker 7\u2019s statement, which is representative of how speakers discussed the experience of women at work: For many of us, it\u2019s a challenge to really feel confident in our own skin in the workplace. As women, we tend to dwell on our weaknesses, and men, I think, focus more on their strengths, and if they don\u2019t have those strengths they\u2019ll hide it and pretend that\u2019s their strength.", "For many of us, it\u2019s a challenge to really feel confident in our own skin in the workplace. As women, we tend to dwell on our weaknesses, and men, I think, focus more on their strengths, and if they don\u2019t have those strengths they\u2019ll hide it and pretend that\u2019s their strength.", "While speakers largely indicated that women become challenged by their male colleagues in ways that keep young female professionals from engaging in work\u2014a core argument of the \u201cLean In\u201d movement, as Speaker 7 said, \u201cself-criticism\u201d frequently turns into women \u201cdissecting our abilities, second-guessing ourselves.\u201d", "We are especially struck by the fact that speakers consistently presented the work environment as one in which women were encouraged to act more like hegemonic characterizations of male colleagues, another example of the speakers\u2019 common commitment to the workplace as an environment of strictly female and male identity\u2014at least in discussions of gender identities (Pullen and Vachhani 2018). Speaker 3, the vice president of a news network, for instance, advises women in masculine-dominated industries, such as journalism, to \u201cnever take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer,\u201d to show \u201ctenacity\u201d in terms of finding a story and \u201cgetting that interview, thinking of plan B when plan A fails. It\u2019s just never giving up.\u201d Again, while we are not critiquing the possible effectiveness of these traits in the workplace from a normative sense, we identify messages of limiting gendered binary approaches within speakers\u2019 recommendations to audiences that highlight main elements of the \u201cLean In\u201d movement that fail to acknowledge difference among workers of the same identity, and moreover, ignore larger societal and cultural forces that oppress through gender stereotypes.", "In fact, speakers\u2019 widespread explanation of \u201cindustry speak\u201d suggested that for women, such a gender binary is a \u201cgood thing,\u201d said Speaker 4, a professor of advertising and public relations, in that it is an environment in which \u201cto show women\u2019s strength.\u201d When listing preferred qualities of a leader in public relations, for instance, Speaker 4, said \u201c[they] must be visionary, proactive, empathetic, confident, courageous, inspiring, flexible, knowledgeable, ethical, adaptable, intuitive, curious, committed, energetic, entrepreneurial, collaborative.\u201d Almost immediately, Speaker 4 indicated that these qualities \u201cfall on the soft side of the types of qualifications that organizations look for in a new hire,\u201d though those \u201csoft\u201d qualifications help female leaders \u201cmodel the way, inspir(e) a shared vision, challenge the process, enabl(e) others to act, encourage the heart.\u201d The speaker also added: \u201cThis is a practice of leadership where you are generous\u2009\u2026\u2009It\u2019s a way of celebrating the values and victories of others by creating a spirit of community.\u201d", "The binary system that was largely celebrated by speakers across these talks proved to be a shared foundation upon which we explicated further meanings of their gendered \u201cindustry speak.\u201d Below, we highlight the discursive strategies of speakers\u2019 narratives about female \u201cempowerment\u201d as being a type of hyper-maternity, further entrenching the notion of a gender binary as an acceptable status quo."]}, {"title": "Leaning on the Norm: Discursive Strategies, Empowerment, and Maternalism", "paragraphs": ["Speakers explained the challenges for women in the communications workforce through \u201cindustry speak\u201d that was used as a tool to subjugate professional women to the norms of a masculine workplace. In fact, women were presented by the speakers as operating within a male\u2013female binary system that, if overcome, make them stronger. Furthermore, these narratives that were presented by several speakers emphasized power in what is called \u201cfemale masculinity,\u201d the recognition of \u201cmasculine\u201d traits of work that operate outside of the masculine body (Pullen and Vachhani 2018).", "For speakers in this study, discourse surrounding empowerment through the feminization of a masculine workplace\u2014or by overcoming gendered challenges at work\u2014included elements of self-deprecation, to present the messages of power as being more palpable. As a television news network executive, Speaker 6, for instance, said: \u201cI may not be a creative person, but I certainly need to create an environment that allows for ideas and innovation and creativity to really thrive within our buildings.\u201d Also Speaker 2, a professor of public relations and advertising, said, \u201c[w]omen in our society are sensitive, everyone is sensitive, to how they are portrayed.

Still, these conversations diverge from complications of intersectionality and of real issues of power within the workplace\u2014and in the industry itself\u2014that create discrimination and harassment in the media workforce. Such complications include, but are not limited to, a lack of racial and gender parity in US newsrooms and media environments (Adams and Cleary 2006; Vardeman-Winter and Place 2017).", "Speaker 10, a television news director, for instance, talked about the role of \u201cbalance\u201d in professional and personal life. \u201cI balance to the best of my ability,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cI fail sometimes.

Speaker 12, a professor of journalism and media studies, provided a list of leadership qualities that focused on \u201cconsensus-building\u201d and team-building in the workplace as another way for women to overcome adversity. \u201c[B]ecause we live in a diverse world,\u201d Speaker 12 said, \u201cif you\u2019re going to truly be a leader, you have to know how to get people to work together toward the same goal.\u201d", "Speakers\u2019 comments encouraging women to build consensus and to work in teams, a trait of the \u201cLean In\u201d movement (Sandberg 2013), despite being a recommendation for career success for women, were rooted in commentary about how women work differently than men\u2014as leaders\u2014and perpetuated a sense of \u201cself-realization\u201d as \u201cempowerment\u201d (Deyrup 2014). \u201cSometimes, we don\u2019t always feel like we are leaders,\u201d Speaker 12 said, and continued: We don\u2019t always avow a leader identity, but what we don\u2019t realize is even in those situations, when we don\u2019t avow a leader identity for ourselves, there could be someone out there ascribing a leader identity to us.", "We don\u2019t always avow a leader identity, but what we don\u2019t realize is even in those situations, when we don\u2019t avow a leader identity for ourselves, there could be someone out there ascribing a leader identity to us.", "Despite suggesting that all women enter the workplace without considering themselves leaders\u2014\u201c[U]se your leadership voice,\u201d Speaker 12 said. \u201cNow that you know you don\u2019t have to find it, you just have to acknowledge that your leadership voice is there and use it\u201d\u2014speakers used the search for leadership traits within audience members (frequently identified by speakers as being largely female) as overcoming gendered social politics of work. Moreover, speakers failed to complicate what may be an overarching gendered (read, masculine) narrative of leadership in media work environments beyond that of self to include larger, societal notions of repression, subjugation, and oppression related to identities of gender, biological sex, class, race, and mental and physical ability, ascribed to individuals or collectives that elevate a single, \u201cbest\u201d type of leadership and work.", "When discussing working as a woman in a \u201cwomen-led agency,\u201d for instance, Speaker 1 stated that: the fact that we were an all women-led agency\u2009\u2026\u2009we probably worked a lot harder because we had to.

As the only speaker to identify issues of intersectionality in discussions of women in the media workplace, taking into consideration multiple elements of identity politics when expressing issues of power, however, Speaker 2 highlighted that: women of color, in particular, may need mentors who can advise about advancing past barriers that are connected to both gender and race, and this is a complex of problems that a white male mentor may not be able to fully address.", "women of color, in particular, may need mentors who can advise about advancing past barriers that are connected to both gender and race, and this is a complex of problems that a white male mentor may not be able to fully address.", "Inherent within all speaker\u2019s comments, however, was the notion that challenges for women in the media workplace were viewed more as novelties that provided a sense of comradery and uniqueness to their positions and workplace contributions. By and large, speakers turned to \u201ctips\u201d and snippets of advice\u2014discursive elements of \u201cindustry speak\u201d (for more see, Holmes, Schnurr, and Marra 2007)\u2014to normalize expectations and processes of work that are based on gender differences.

We conclude below with further comment about this study\u2019s findings, implications to journalism practice, and the need for future research."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As stated earlier, we do not deny that particular social collectives are subject to harassment and discrimination in the workforce. Nor do we deny that the treatment of one group of people based on identity is the same as the treatment of another. In other words, we believe that employees are treated differently in media work environments based on gendered identities in that many employees, based on these identities, tend to be paid less and are subject to different social expectations based on systems of power. This paper, however, has been interested in identifying the embedders of these ideologies within career and leadership advance by media professionals. Furthermore, while we have been interested in the degree to which the speakers\u2019 \u201cindustry speak\u201d pairs with the popular \u201cLean In\u201d movement, we are even more interested in how, as a collective, the speakers\u2019 rhetoric formed an arena of \u201cpost-feminist\u201d views of a meritocracy in which women, to \u201csucceed\u201d as \u201cleaders,\u201d must abide by certain standards of behavior and language. Here, we provide several concluding thoughts related to this study\u2019s findings.", "First, we have argued that there is a basis for further research to examine the degree to which \u201cindustry speak\u201d within the fields of journalism, public relations, and advertising may align with many tenets of the \u201cLean In\u201d movement. In that respect, we suggest that media scholars explore the multiple layers of the movement and the language used by professionals to discuss challenges for advancement in the workplace. We understand that broad generalizations may not be made from these findings and that the comments made by speakers in this study are the result of multiple influences, including their own personal beliefs, expectations of and for speakers discussing issues of women in communication, and a host of other variables. However, the consistency between the speakers\u2019 comments over a period of several years is interesting, particularly since they have been deemed\u2014in this case anyway\u2014as industry experts. In the future, therefore, we suggest professionals also consider the degree to which these efforts to identify challenges and diversify based on binaries of female\u2013male, without diminishing those dimensions, operates to exclude further complications of race, class, physical and mental abilities, and other elements of social interaction.", "Second, we suggest that the intersectionality necessary to extend beyond the commonalities among the speech of professionals analyzed in this study would be a direct attack against what research and the speakers\u2019 stories describe as a well-established, hetero-masculine environment of working within US media. That the speakers over this period of time each described means by which to project women into positions of leadership and identified that career projection is a difficult\u2014and gendered\u2014experience, suggests that, indeed, there are issues within the structures of media fields that remain unaddressed, or certainly unchanged. Despite the solutions and ideological approaches to address the problems, it remains important to openly share and critique professionals\u2019 commentary about their fields and experiences as a means to dissect influences of power. That said, professionals should also be aware of the potential challenges to their own positions and experiences as they address power systems within their places of work. Indeed, as this study also suggests, the indoctrination to the status quo is ripe with slang, career advice, and ideologies that may provide professionals with lessons that are counterproductive to changing power systems.", "Third, this study becomes relevant for those interested in improving not only the working environment of those in media fields, but in improving the relevance and meaning of journalism by creating a more equitable and diverse newsroom. For a field seen across the globe as one that, to varying degrees, is to serve a public good and highlight social conditions and ills with an attempt to inform audiences about how to make change through engagement and civic institutions, ensuring that the institution of journalism itself is fair and equitable seems paramount."]}], "references": [{"title": "The Parity Paradox: Reader Response to Minority Newsroom Staffing", "year": "2006", "journal": "Mass Communication and Society", "volume": "9", "authors": [{"name": "Adams Terry", "first_name": "Adams", "last_name": "Terry"}, {"name": "Cleary Johanna", "first_name": "Cleary", "last_name": "Johanna"}]}, {"title": "Leading with Their Hearts?
