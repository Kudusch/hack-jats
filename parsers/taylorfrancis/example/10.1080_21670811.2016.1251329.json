One initiative being taken by news organisations, as reported by Nieman Lab on July 13, 2015, for example, is to switch from http to the more secure https protocol.", "On the shift to a legal and technical defence in most known cases involving communications interception, the journalist has not been provided with an opportunity to argue against access to communications data. Although this aspect of RIPA was changed with the Serious Crime Act in 2015, on July 22, 2015 Press Gazette reported that there had already been a subsequent application where a judge was involved but the journalist was not put on notice.", "It is not just legal avenues where the organisation may not be aware of attempts being made to access sources or systems. The remote access of journalists\u2019 computers at Al Jazeera and surveillance of Der Spiegel were only revealed years after the acts had taken place, while a UNESCO report notes that \u201cNews organizations and individual journalists do not often know or share that they have been victims of digital attacks\u201d (Henruchsen, Betz, and Lisosky 2015).", "On targeting indirectly, there is evidence of both widespread ignorance of the legal means available to authorities, and technical vulnerabilities.

Meanwhile, technological and commercial developments point to an ongoing increase in the monitoring of people\u2019s behaviour which is likely to impact on journalists and their sources. RFID tags, for example (used in staff ID tags and passes, allowing the tracking of movement within a building) were used by the Justice Department to establish contact between an employee and a reporter (Lashmar, 2016), while event data recorders (\u201cblack boxes\u201d installed in cars to record details about what the vehicle is doing) have been used by law enforcement without warrant (Abelson, Ledeen, and Lewis 2008), and \u201cwearable technology\u201d such as the FitBit were used for the first time in a Canadian court of law in 2014 (Crawford, Lingel, and Karppi 2015).", "On July 30, 2015, The Register reported that facial recognition had been used by a UK police force at a music festival.
