Eventually, which performance stands out as resonant is contingent upon the script, the actors, the audience, the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, and social power. Initially, the performance of Free Tibet protesters was judged to be more authentic through coherent media framing. But the subsequent redress phase saw a return of the affirmative narrative made possible by the redefinition of the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne following the Wenchuan earthquake and authorities\u2019 enhanced capability in controlling symbolic production. The Chinese performance came to be seen as more or less authentic, hence strategic public diplomacy was transformed into a ritual-like experience. The article reads media events as neither a mythical system functioning in a consensual way nor merely an ideology serving instrumental interests.

As an extraordinary media event, the Games celebrate individual excellence united under a consensus over the \u201clegal-rational\u201d principle, which is the cornerstone of modernity. They also embody the ideal of human solidarity despite a reality of economic and political conflicts. But precisely because Olympianism represents universal ideals, since its inception it has been a source of appropriation by strategic actors, from nation-states to transnational corporations to the global civil society alike. The Games \u201care used as blank slates, as empty stages available for all sorts of new dramaturgies besides their own, scrolls that have been written upon, scraped almost clean, and written upon again\u201d (Dayan 2008, 391). The paradoxical reality of the Olympics as both a system of universal values and a means for strategic interest, like that of culture in general, has been an enduring source of interest for scholars.", "This article studies the most expensive media event to date, the Beijing Olympics, as a transnational social drama. While China spent \u201cbiblical seven years\u201d (Friedman 2008) in preparing for its \u201ccoming-out party,\u201d the run-up to the Beijing Games saw a breach of the Olympic norm. During the international torch relay, China\u2019s Olympic stage was almost taken over by Free Tibet supporters as well as other activists who sought to use the Games to leverage China in both domestic and foreign policy realms. The Games averted a downward spiral only after its platform returned to China, where it was turned from a discordant social drama back to an affirmative event.", "The Beijing Games remain a fascinating cultural performance for global communication scholars. However, to date, few works have approached the event through a media ritual perspective. The ones that did were mostly confined to studying the heavily ritualized Opening Ceremony (Cui 2013; Luo 2010). But moving beyond the ceremonial moment, how can a media ritual perspective inform our understanding of the extended drama before and during the Beijing Games? Did the conflicts that almost wrecked the Games in the run-up to it eventually get ritualized, and if so, what was the mechanism leading to ritualization? How does the trajectory of the Games connect to the paradigm shift in media ritual studies from structural functionalism to a focus with conflict and power, as well as inform us about the phenomenon of \u201cgenre transgression\u201d that results in \u201csubverted, diverted, or perverted events\u201d (Dayan 2008, 399; Hepp and Couldry 2009; Katz and Liebes 2007)? These are the key questions this article tries to answer."]}, {"title": "Theoretical Framework: Ritualizing Media Events Through Resonance-crafting", "paragraphs": ["Media ritual scholarship began with the study of media performances enacted around dramatic events that affirm the core values of a society. This is symbolized by the publication of Dayan and Katz\u2019s (1992) Media Events: The Live Broadcasting of History, which had at its core an aesthetic theory of how the then new medium\u2014live television\u2014turned otherwise ritualized events into mediated rituals (e.g., coronation and contest), or made non-ritualized events truly transformative (e.g., conquest) (Coman 2005).", "Syntactically, a media event begins with a \u201cseparation\u201d from mundane life. This is followed by a \u201climinal\u201d stage in which what divides us in everyday life gives way to anti-structural communitas guided by symbolic logic, where social relations assume a subjunctive mode of what they ought to be (Coman 2005). The final stage is \u201creintegration,\u201d where ritual agents with a transformed status rejoin everyday life (van Gennep 1961). Semantically, media events are high holidays celebrating the sacred values of a community or promoting a message of \u201creconciliation\u201d proposed by event organizers. Pragmatically, a media event enthralls a nation or the world.", "The ritual dimension of \u201cmedia events\u201d lies in media\u2019s employment of recurring formal features in narrating special categories of events. Ritualization can be seen as a process of crafting resonance, a textual effect that points to \u201ca public and cultural relation among object, tradition and audience\u201d (Schudson 1989, 170). Resonance often entails a consensual narrative choice by media, suggesting a tight coupling between the actual event and \u201cstory about it\u201d (Schudson 2007), which in turn strikes a responsive chord with the audience.", "While media events underscore consensus, \u201cit requires only a small shift of focus to see rituals as expression of power\u201d (Elliott 1982, 584; Couldry 2003). All rituals embody the paradoxical co-presence of structure and anti-structure (Turner [1969] 2007). Elliott debunked the two meanings of \u201csolidarity\u201d: \u201ctogetherness\u201d and \u201cloyalty.\u201d While \u201ctogetherness\u201d implies anti-structure and is the more usual Durkheimian interpretation of ritual, \u201cloyalty\u201d stresses an element of subordination by those who participate in the ritual to those who organize it. Even the liminal phase supposedly characterized by undifferentiated communitas is sustained as much by models of authority as models of cooperation. An affirmative media event is thus better understood as an establishment-centered event in which media (usually referring to news media) shed their critical stance to act as chorus, thus joining organizers as \u201critual principals.\u201d", "While authorities strategically use affirmative events to legitimize their authority, their challengers are equally tempted to appropriate the universality of ritual rhetoric to advance their own interest (Kertzer 1988). This adds a conflict dimension to rituals. Recent scholarship has increasingly addressed the role of conflict in media events (Hepp and Couldry 2009), incorporating both threats originating from outside a society, such as wars, terror attacks, and disasters (Katz and Liebes 2007; Liebes 1998; Liebes and Blondheim 2005; Rothenbuhler 2005), or from within a society, such as scandals or moral outrage (Alexander and Jacobs 1998; Carey 1998; Cottle 2006; Ettema 2005). Adding to these are scenarios where affirmative events experience a \u201cgenre transgression,\u201d resulting in \u201csubverted, diverted, or perverted events\u201d (Dayan 2008, 399; Durham 2008).", "Unlike affirmative events that mark the preplanned and orderly transition of ritual agents to the next life stage, the more suspenseful \u201csocial drama\u201d paradigm (Turner 1980) is instructive for our understanding of conflict-oriented events. A social drama begins with a public breach of a society\u2019s law or moral norms, often challenging entrenched authority. This is followed by a crisis stage in which conflict develops along the most acerbic social fault-line and everyone is compelled to take sides. The third stage is redress during which \u201credressive mechanisms\u2009\u2026\u2009are brought into operation\u2009\u2026\u2009ranging from personal advice and informal arbitration to formal juridical and legal machinery\u201d (Turner 1980, 147). It leads to a final stage of either reintegration or perpetuated conflicts, depending on how well the conflicts are ritualized. While social drama has a conflictual form, its effect may be functional. \u201cThe simple fact of ritualizing a conflict, of formulating it on a symbolic register, diminishes its conflictual nature\u201d (Dayan 2005, 171).", "If affirmative events foreground consensus, a mediated social drama is better seen as a contest whereby news media engage other powerful social institutions in stylistic but contentious public performances, in which a dominant script can only be gradually discerned. Eventually, which performance will stand out as resonant hinges on a number of factors, including the script, the actor, the audience, the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, and social power (Alexander 2004). The script that supports the performance must be seen to achieve both \u201cextension\u201d with the background culture and \u201cpsychological identification\u201d with an audience who will recognize the script by heart. The actors that perform the script must appear authentic to the roles conferred by the script, i.e., their strategic intention must remain hidden. Moreover, the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, or the temporal\u2013spatial environment in which the performance takes place, and the social power that controls the means of symbolic production, shall work in support of the performance to make it resonant.", "Further, linking the ritual-oriented \u201csocial drama\u201d frame to the more familiar cognitive frame of \u201csocial problem,\u201d Ettema (2005, 134) offered an operational index for studying resonance, which he defined as \u201can effect produced by the same process of (crafting) salience when accomplished with eloquence.\u201d Specifically, resonance is revealed through media\u2019s recurrent use of narrative and rhetorical devices in the discursive processes of articulation, punctuation, and attribution. Articulation resembles a building structure and refers to the way \u201ca vast array of events and experiences are hung together in a relatively unified and meaningful fashion\u201d (Ettema 2009, 297; Snow and Benford 1992, 138). Punctuation refers to the definition of a problem. Like a picture frame, it involves the selection of facts so some aspects of an issue will appear more salient (Entman 1993). Finally, attribution \u201cidentifies culpable agents and specifies actions necessary to ameliorate the problem\u201d (Ettema 2005, 133). The incorporation of the cognition-driven \u201csocial problem\u201d frame (i.e., \u201cpunctuation\u201d and \u201cattribution\u201d) into a ritual-oriented \u201csocial drama\u201d frame in the crafting of \u201cresonance\u201d shows the deliberative potential of a social drama and \u201cthe firm grip of technical rationality on contemporary ritual, with its insistence that things must be and can be explained\u201d (Ettema 1990, 327).", "News media\u2019s role in \u201ccrafting the resonance\u201d of a social drama deserves particular attention. As the most important social institution of symbolic production, news media often serve as the final arbiter of social performances, i.e., they confer a discursive form on events that implicitly contains a critique on the \u201cauthenticity\u201d of other social actors. Media, therefore, \u201ccontain the political within the cultural\u201d and herein we find media\u2019s symbolic power (Ettema 1990, 325). If news media\u2019s normative role during an affirmative event is a \u201cchorus to power,\u201d the networked media environment and globalization bring new uncertainties. For instance, when non-governmental organizations (NGOs) of the international civil society target an event to champion their own cause, an affirmative event is likely to transgress into a \u201csocial drama.\u201d For sure, appropriating an existing event platform for other purposes raises questions about legitimacy. Within the commercial realm, there are clear protocols against the practice of \u201cambush marketing\u201d (Payne 2012; Price 2008). However, things are less clear when values celebrated by a media event are appropriated for political purposes by parties other than the event owners. This presents a dilemma for mainstream media: should they remain committed to their \u201cchorus\u201d role, or take the protesters\u2019 perspective in \u201cadvocating\u201d for change regarding a deep-rooted social conflict that now lies exposed? How can news media continue to craft a resonant script now that the media event seems to embark on an uncertain and conflictual path? These are key issues that media have to sort out in their interaction with both the event organizers and their detractors. This said, media\u2019s power to enjoin national authorities for redressive action in a transnational social drama is eventually limited, as the transnational public sphere is in want of an accountability mechanism of government power, as well as effective norms that may bring about conflict resolution (Benson 2015; Br\u00fcggemann and Wessler 2014; Hepp and Couldry 2009).", "As a quintessential genre of media events, the Olympic Games introduce a \u201climinal\u201d phase in which athletes from around the world engage in competitions that celebrate individual excellence embedded in universal humanity, irrespective of one\u2019s racial, ethnic, religious, or national background. However, beneath the veneer of solidarity lies Olympic ritual\u2019s power dimension (Billings 2009; Hayashi et al. 2016; Roche 2000). The institutional custodians of the Olympic Movement (the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and National Olympic Committees), the host city, the corporate sponsors, as well as Olympic media are structured in the dominant. These ritual principals enjoy contractually guaranteed rights to be associated with the Games\u2019 symbolism that is denied to \u201cfree-riders.\u201d However, marginal actors often try to appropriate the visibility of the platform for their own cause (Price 2008). Instead of papering over social and political conflicts, the Olympics often become a social drama that magnifies conflicts.", "As it is, a structural-functionalist reading emphasizing the Games\u2019 symbolism remains idealistic. From a power perspective, a successful Olympics can be read as a triumph of the host nation\u2019s public diplomacy. For instance, the Beijing Organizing Committee (BOCOG) and the Chinese state intended to use the Games as a \u201ccoming-out-party\u201d for China, making it strategic communication par excellence. From a conflict perspective, the Olympic platform is a fertile ground for confrontation (Tomlinson and Young 2006), from saber-rattling international politics (Moscow 1980 and Los Angeles 1984 when the Soviet Union and United States rotated boycotts) to domestic protests (Mexico City 1968 and Seoul 1988); and is open to appropriation by marginal players from issue-driven NGOs (Beijing 2008) to terrorists (Munich 1972). In Beijing\u2019s case, China\u2019s heightened attention to its image and the moral legitimacy offered by hosting the Games changed the relations between China, foreign media, and transnational civil society. This set the stage in which different actors would use the Games to leverage China on issues ranging from human rights to ethnic conflicts and foreign policy (Brownell 2012; Han 2011; Horne and Whannel 2010). Beijing tried to define the Games in its own terms, while its challengers claimed the meaning of the Games should not be exhausted by rights-holding entities alone. They engaged each other in a contentious performance deeply implicated in the global \u201cpolitical economy of collective attention\u201d (Dayan 2008). Each party endeavored to ritualize its performance, i.e., to be seen as authentic and thus achieve resonance with a by-standing public.", "Eventually, ritualization not only grows out of interaction between the script, the actors, and audience, but is also the result of different parties\u2019 ability to control means of symbolic production, as well as the general ecology of events around the focal event (the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne). Changes in the final two elements were crucial to the turn-around of the Beijing Games from disruption to affirmation. Social movement theorists have argued that for resource-poor actors such as NGOs, hijacking an existing platform, with its \u201cpotential to embarrass,\u201d may be \u201cthe most important tactic available\u201d (Gamson 2004, 258). But after the authorities readjust their strategies, the authenticity of activists may be compromised (Downey 1986). In light of this, a central research question for studying Olympics as a transnational social drama is analyzing how and why a particular performance stands out as resonant, as well as media\u2019s role in contributing to that perceived resonance. At the heart of the question is also a discussion of the nature of conflict ritualization mechanism involved.", "This theoretical section will end with a qualification. Granted, resonance necessarily supposes audience response to the frame adopted by the journalists and in turn embedded in the media text, while this study offers no such evidence. By priming producer-level practice, the study tries to complement effects tradition\u2019s inattentiveness to the interaction between journalists and other social institutions in producing a \u201cresonant script,\u201d as well as the formal qualities of the script that does the actual ideological work. This is not to say that consensual media framing will always produce a \u201cdominant reading\u201d (Hall [1980] 1992). But it does argue that the former is a necessary, if not sufficient condition in inducing \u201cresonance\u201d towards a particular script at the audience level. This makes studying how media producers, event owners, and their challengers negotiate towards a consensus (or failure thereof) as important as testing the effect of the frame\u2019s perceived resonance. In other words, just like \u201cagenda-building\u201d studies produce value independent from \u201cagenda-setting\u201d studies, there is also value in studies that zero in on producers\u2019 efforts at \u201ccrafting resonance.\u201d", "Thus, this paper takes seriously the suggestion that \u201can operational indicator of the journalistic effort to craft resonance is the recurrence of formal textual features\u2014the repeated distillation of the event to the same few iconic elements\u201d (Ettema 2005, 134). At the same time, it tries to push the insight further, by demonstrating that journalists\u2019 effort at crafting resonance may itself be a conflicted process, especially when they are torn between competing allegiances as a media event experiences a \u201ctransgression of genre,\u201d a trend closely connected to the twin forces of globalization and the rise of interactive media technologies. This said, failure to study audience perception of resonance or the mediation of the event across different platforms are weak links of this paper. Future studies may further investigate the role of the digitally empowered audience in \u201cco-producing\u201d or \u201ccontesting\u201d the resonance of an event with or against the event\u2019s ritual principals, including professional media makers."]}, {"title": "Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The following case study on how the Beijing Olympics evolved as a transnational social drama is based on a combination of discourse analysis, content analysis, and in-depth interviews. The media discourse under analysis is drawn from four elite newspapers in two leading English-speaking countries: United States and United Kingdom.1 The newspapers are The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The Daily Telegraph, which, given their liberal- or conservative-leaning editorial stances, represent the spectrum of \u201clegitimate controversy\u201d (Hallin 1989) within their respective societies. The author searched the Proquest database regarding these newspapers using \u201cBeijing Olympics\u201d as key search terms for the entire year of 2008. Among the articles, the author zeroed in on the four papers\u2019 Olympic coverage from the beginning of the international torch relay (March 25) to the end of the Olympic month (August 31).", "While the original media events theory foregrounds live broadcasting, this paper analyzes discourse drawn from Western press. Katz and Dayan (2017) recently noted that their original theory emphasized the \u201cconsensual\u201d nature of the event\u2019s mediation, which did not preclude print media even though the latter have a different aesthetic form from television. Beyond \u201cmedia events,\u201d the cultural studies of journalism take an active interest in the ritual dimension of everyday journalism which is often text-based (Bird and Dardenne 1988; Ettema 2005; Lule 2001). Meanwhile, the extended duration of the Olympic-related events under study, which includes not only the Games but also the torch relay in the months leading up to them, makes studying press coverage a more realistic but still valid choice. Given this paper\u2019s focus on institutional interaction, the decision to choose the elite rather than popular press is informed by the fact that the former played a more important role in shaping the Olympic organizers\u2019 media strategies (personal communication with a BOCOG official, September 24, 2008). Compared to the popular press, the elite press also has better resources and is more committed to sponsoring expensive foreign coverage.", "To complement the limited scope of discourse analysis, the paper draws on in-depth interviews and personal communication with reporters and other personnel involved in the Beijing Olympics during the author\u2019s fieldwork in Beijing between June 2008 and May 2009 and subsequently in December 2011, numbering around 40. The interview subjects include foreign correspondents from leading international news agencies, newspapers, news magazines, and international broadcasters; Chinese reporters, producers, and executives working for China Central Television (CCTV) Sports, the Chinese state broadcaster and the Olympic television rights holder; as well as several officials working for BOCOG. The names of the interviewees and their affiliated organizations were kept anonymous according to Institutional Review Board agreement. Finally, to gauge how the collective memories of the Beijing Games pan out in international media in the post-Olympic era, the author conducted a content analysis of articles containing the term \u201cBeijing Olympics\u201d in the four newspapers (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The Daily Telegraph) between the end of the Beijing Games and the end of the Rio Games in 2016, and assessed the nature of the reference (i.e., whether it drew positive, neutral, or negative associations with China). While the event under examination took place a number of years ago, this paper is primarily aimed at making new theoretical contributions to the study of global sports media events by revisiting these data."]}, {"title": "Breach", "paragraphs": ["According to Turner (1974, 38), in initiating a social drama, \u201cthe incident of breach may be deliberately, even calculatedly, contrived by a person or party disposed to\u2009\u2026\u2009challenge entrenched authority.\u201d China\u2019s Olympic discourse took a toll when the spotlight of the flame ceremony in Athens was seized by members of the Paris-based rights group Reporters Without Borders.

While Tibet is part of China and diplomatically no country recognizes otherwise, the Tibetan region had an entangled historical relationship with Han Chinese. Outside of China, organized groups that promote Tibetan independence, such as the Tibetan-government-in-exile and Students for a Free Tibet, had been planning to use the Games as an opportunity to make their voice heard.", "The Tibet-related protests had an immediate precursor in March, when monks in Lhasa took to the street on the eve of the anniversary of the failed 1959 uprising. The protests soon descended into deadly riots, killing 22 people according to the Chinese sources, among whom most were civilian Han people and policemen. The Free Tibet sources put the casualties at 140, most of whom were Tibetans (Leow 2008; The Wall Street Journal 2008).", "The disruption of the torch ceremony nearly two weeks after the riots helped to create a momentum that compelled the world\u2019s media to turn their attention from the Olympics to the issue of Tibet. In other words, \u201cFree Tibet\u201d supporters successfully inserted a structural social problem into a supposedly anti-structural sports event. However, the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of using the Olympic platform to champion another cause demanded justification. This became a key concern that media implicitly addressed in their subsequent coverage.", "The media framing surrounding the question of definition or \u201cpunctuation\u201d remained coherent.

In news treatment the journalists honored the principle of \u201cbalance,\u201d by giving voice to both the protesters and the Greek IOC officials as well as the Chinese organizers. While the protesters pointed to the \u201chuman rights abuses in the world\u2019s most populous country,\u201d the IOC officials and their Chinese counterparts condemned the protesters and insisted that politics should be kept out of sports. However, in editorials the meaning of the \u201cbreach\u201d was made more explicit. For instance, one Telegraph commentary noted, \u201c[If] the Olympic Games can bring light to political murk\u2009\u2026\u2009we should celebrate its most elevated function\u201d (White 2008a). Here, by aligning the Olympic norms and values with the cause of Free Tibet and by demanding the Chinese government honors the pledge to improve human rights that it made upon winning the Olympic bid (Anast and Spencer 2008), the media effectively legitimized the protests."]}, {"title": "Crisis", "paragraphs": ["In a social drama, \u201cunless the breach can be sealed off quickly, there is a tendency for the breach to widen\u2009\u2026\u2009until it becomes coextensive with some dominant cleavage in the\u2009\u2026\u2009social relations\u201d (Turner 1974, 38).

The Guardian summarized the Parisian experience: Mercifully for bruised British egos\u2009\u2026\u2009the torch\u2019s progress through Paris yesterday looked almost as chaotic: officials cancelled the final running stages of the relay, extinguished the torch and hustled it on to a bus on several occasions as a succession of protesters were wrestled to the ground by security officials as demonstrators tried to grab the flame. (Barkham 2008)The torch\u2019s passing in San Francisco, while not as chaotic, was not the kind of joyous party anticipated by Olympic enthusiasts but a \u201cdisappointment\u201d as the route was changed at the last minute (McKinley 2008).", "Mercifully for bruised British egos\u2009\u2026\u2009the torch\u2019s progress through Paris yesterday looked almost as chaotic: officials cancelled the final running stages of the relay, extinguished the torch and hustled it on to a bus on several occasions as a succession of protesters were wrestled to the ground by security officials as demonstrators tried to grab the flame. (Barkham 2008)", "These narratives featured ideal archetypes. The protesters became \u201csymbols of resistance\u201d and their advocacy represented \u201cthe chaotic freedom of democracy.\u201d By contrast, the Chinese security guards were called \u201cflame retardants.\u201d \u201cSome saw their black leather gloves, earpieces and single-minded determination to keep the flame burning as a visible demonstration of Chinese police state-type muscle in London\u201d (Barkham 2008). The New York Times quoted an angry protester, \u201cYou have to ask: Where were these security men last week? Beating up people in the villages of China, no doubt\u201d (Burns 2008).", "If the articulation frame made the city-to-city relay interesting, the punctuation frame made the issue important by repeatedly naming the situation as \u201ca public relations disaster\u201d (Burns 2008; Kelso 2008a) that \u201cleft the organizers\u2009\u2026\u2009deeply embarrassed\u201d (Edwards and Thomas 2008). The Wall Street Journal quoted a blogger who likened the process to \u201cwatching the world\u2019s biggest, slowest traffic accident\u201d (Fowler 2008). In such a farce, the inversed power relations between \u201cleaders\u201d and \u201crebels,\u201d like a medieval carnival, promised laughter and not sympathy. The Guardian\u2019s editorialist Simon Jenkins unveiled the meaning of the narrative form most trenchantly: Confess it, you have not enjoyed a story so much in years. A round-the-world marathon with all-in wrestling, kick boxing, rugby tackling and sanctimonious steeple-chasing, staged free of charge in the streets of London, Paris and San Francisco by the International Olympics Committee\u2014and before the Beijing games have even started. To add to the joy, nobody gets hurt except politicians. (Jenkins 2008a)As Dayan and Katz (1992) noted in their classic study of media events, when an affirmative event is hijacked, introducing a competing script, it poses a \u201cdilemma\u201d for media in terms of its position vis-\u00e0-vis the event organizers. If consensus between media and event organizers is all but taken-for-granted when things go well, a turn towards conflict will likely induce a return to the professional norm of \u201cbalance,\u201d as long as the intruding actor is seen as a \u201clegitimate\u201d source. However, in reporting acute social conflicts, even as media try to give voice to \u201cmultiple sides,\u201d it is hard to stay \u201cneutral.\u201d Ettema and Glasser (1998) wrote that the craft of investigative journalists lies in appropriating yet transcending the objectivity norm through the strategic use of irony, thus conveying a sense of moral outrage even as journalists profess to be committed to professionalism. Here, similarly, even as journalists quoted both protesters and the Chinese officials, their consistent adoption of ironic farce served to convey sympathy for the protesters and a call to account on the part of the Chinese organizers. Indeed, the transgression of an event from affirmation to conflict compels a change in media\u2019s role, i.e., the journalists move from a normative \u201cchorus role\u201d required of a media event, in which they form a de facto partnership with the event organizers or the power establishment, to an \u201cadvocate role\u201d in which they take on power, as when they cover scandals, moral outrage, or occasionally in covering social movements as well.", "Confess it, you have not enjoyed a story so much in years.

To add to the joy, nobody gets hurt except politicians. (Jenkins 2008a)", "This advocacy role of media was made nowhere more explicit than the editorials, where media tried to come up with an attribution frame. The Guardian ran an article entitled \u201c10 Burning Questions About the Olympic Torch,\u201d in which the answer to \u201cwho to blame\u201d was: \u201cTake your pick\u2014Gordon [Prime Minister Gordon Brown], Ken [Mayor of London Ken Livingstone], China, the police, our feckless society, the chaotic freedoms of real democracy\u201d (Barkham 2008). Ultimately, the Chinese organizers took the blame for \u201chuman rights abuses,\u201d which contradicted the Olympic charter and led to the disruption during the torch relay. The editorial also argued that the \u201cpublic relations disaster\u201d grew out of China\u2019s hubris: Had the Chinese and the IOC been shrewd, they would have avoided democracies altogether, or at least they would have run the torch inside stadiums, where they could ensure photo-opportunities with politicians smiling\u2009\u2026\u2009Instead they craved geographical authenticity\u2009\u2026\u2009They both got a raspberry. (Jenkins 2008a)This comment goes to the heart of media\u2019s critique: China\u2019s Olympic diplomacy backfired because it opted for a wrong script in the wrong scene. Power rituals in authoritarian societies have to be tightly controlled to take effect, which is antithesis to the \u201cstreet theater\u201d type of spontaneous festival that defines the torch relay. The poignancy is that authorities invited humiliation because of their own ignorance. \u201cSimple ignorance is safe from irony, but ignorance compounded with the least degree of confidence counts as intellectual hubris and is a punishable offense\u201d (Ettema and Glasser 1998, 90).", "Had the Chinese and the IOC been shrewd, they would have avoided democracies altogether, or at least they would have run the torch inside stadiums, where they could ensure photo-opportunities with politicians smiling\u2009\u2026\u2009Instead they craved geographical authenticity\u2009\u2026\u2009They both got a raspberry.

The Guardian reported that \u201cafter a week that has seen the Olympic flame scorned on two continents\u2009\u2026\u2009the IOC\u2009\u2026\u2009conceded what has long been apparent to many observers: China\u2019s hosting of the 2008 games has tipped the Olympic movement into crisis\u201d (Kelso 2008b). The IOC would in time abandon the ritual of international torch relay altogether (Kelso, Dodd, and Branigan 2008).", "For the crisis at hand, what was proposed by the global civil society was \u201cboycotting the Opening Ceremony.\u201d The idea was resolutely throttled back by both IOC and China. IOC President Jacques Rogge maintained there was no \u201cmomentum\u201d for a boycott, as \u201cthe major political leaders don\u2019t want one\u201d (Anast and Spencer 2008). He reminded the world that the Olympic Movement had weathered more serious crises before and rebounded (Ziegler 2008). The Chinese officials not only dismissed the idea of boycott, but that of calling the torch relay \u201ca crisis\u201d as well, confident that \u201cthe Games would go on to be a success\u201d (Spencer 2008).", "But in newspapers\u2019 editorials, arguments for and against a boycott were exchanged energetically. Those approving the idea drew analogy with the Nazi Olympics, \u201cOlympics have always been meat and drink to fascist and communist regimes, with their\u2009\u2026\u2009use of sport as weapon of propaganda.\u201d In between the lines there was also fear of a rising China: \u201ca regime which is resolutely anti-freedom and ruthlessly nationalistic has shown that it can win.\u201d The recommendation was to have \u201cworld leaders stay away from its repulsive ceremonies and leave the sportsmen to get on with it\u201d (Moore 2008).", "Others mocked the idea for its hypocrisy, arguing that \u201can expediency not simultaneously summoned from worldwide commercial, industrial and cultural contacts with China\u201d could only \u201cleave the Olympics exposed as a soft option\u201d (Miller 2008). In other words, the Olympics as a human festival should not be instrumentalized if agents in the political and economic fields did not sacrifice their interests first.", "One rare commentary in the Telegraph, however, complained that the dominant Western perspective failed to give China agency: Before the moral majority round up another posse to ride to the planet's rescue, China asks that the liberal lynch mob look at the socio-political map from its point of view, and to consider not where China is or was but where it is going.

Similar pressure was on the US President from presidential candidates in an election year."]}, {"title": "Redress", "paragraphs": ["As of early May, no prospects of settling the dispute were in sight.

Just as the situation looked to get stalled, a huge earthquake that ravaged China\u2019s Sichuan province on May 12, 2008 and claimed tens of thousands of lives introduced a powerful jolt to a troubled Olympics. The earthquake upstaged news headlines of the torch relay.

The torch relay tipped the delicate balance between China\u2019s public diplomacy and domestic security objectives. Henceforth official ambition was downgraded from the normative goal of hosting the \u201cbest Olympics\u201d to a strategic goal of hosting a \u201csafe Olympics.\u201d3", "The most important measures focused on controlling the physical access to the Olympic stage. Officials started reigning in on visa issuance. Immediately related to the control over symbolic production was protracted negotiations over when, where, and how foreign journalists could report from key sites such as Tiananmen Square, venue of the crushed 1989 student movement (Stelter 2008; Wade 2008a, 2008b).

The public relations scheme was in response to suggestions that the police should avoid overreaction to protests lest they \u201cturn nothing into a four-day story.\u201d6 According to a Chinese television documentary aired after the Olympics, these suggestions eventually prompted a rethinking of the security protocols. In a televised conference, the Minister of Public Security, Meng Jianzhu, was seen instructing his colleagues on how to avoid confrontation with protesters, by clasping his hands at the back as an example of refraining from the use of force.7 Security personnel being interviewed said the training made them realize that crafting a good image was the \u201cinternational standard.\u201d8"]}, {"title": "Reintegration", "paragraphs": ["In the prolonged redress phase of the social drama, an earthquake reshaped the environment of the event while organizers tried to regain control and launched defensive public relations, such that by the eve of the Games, there was no overarching counter-narrative.

A culture is not a unified system that pushes action in a consistent direction.\u201d The less-palatable memories associated with a divisive Olympics will be occasionally evoked, as when political reporters write about new developments to old conflicts that triggered the controversy in the run-up to the Beijing Games.

Yet during later Olympiads (the London and Rio Games), which saw a surge of articles containing references to the Beijing Games, coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. It seems appropriate to say that when we examine the Olympics as a cultural genre, the \u201csports/anti-structural\u201d frames belong to the extraordinary when media are more willing to suspend disbelief; while the \u201cpolitical/conflict\u201d frames are more likely to belong to the ordinary time."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["This article studies the change from affirmation to conflicts and back to affirmation in the most expensively produced mega-sports event in history and proposes a theoretical framework for studying mega-events as a transnational social drama.

Instead, agents of subnational separatism, along with other groups with grievances, competed for legitimacy in defining reality and turned the prelude to the Games into a conflict-ridden social drama. Such a contest demonstrates the difficulty of owning an event even with the full backing of state power.", "Partly the global civil society\u2019s advocacy succeeded initially because international media departed from their \u201cchorus\u201d role. With coherent narrative and rhetorical choices, elite Western media positioned themselves as the global community\u2019s conscience holding the Chinese state accountable for possible human rights abuses. They played an important role in conferring authenticity on some performances but not others.", "However, a \u201ctransnational social drama\u201d suffers from a lack of an accountability mechanism. Attribution and proposals advanced by Western media did not resonate with the Chinese public. The rituals designed to shame China, instead of soliciting sympathetic views, were read as \u201cinsults\u201d by nationalist Chinese. As the international public sphere was ruminating over boycott as possible redress, the Chinese launched their counter-boycotts of foreign brands, politicians, and media for perceived bias. As it was, public opinion allowed the Chinese government to deflect tension and not submit to terms proposed by the West.", "As the social drama progressed, the question of \u201cwhose\u201d performance can be ritualized became an over-determined process involving not only key actors, their scripts, and media critique, but also the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne as well as the power to control symbolic production, which, if exercised at their best, could come off as transparent. The sudden earthquake and effective rescue work created a liminal moment that turned public opinion around. Also, once the Games\u2019 platform moved back to China, authorities could reassert powerful control over the means of symbolic production, including the event stage itself. This means that the deeply divisive ethnic conflicts that got exposed through the Olympic platform, and which constituted the \u201ccore problem\u201d of the \u201ctransnational social drama,\u201d eventually failed to produce a \u201cresonant\u201d answer of their own. There would be room for future deliberation of these issues elsewhere. But not here. Not over the Olympic stage.", "Thus, when all strategic efforts were registered and reckoned with, ritualization relies on a triumph on the symbolic plane, i.e., when contending parties are willing to suspend disbelief, even if briefly (MacAloon 1984). In this case, because China managed to hold onto its master narrative in the final stage, the earlier deviations could be temporarily forgotten. While rituals may be manipulated by some groups most of the time, they also create symbolic irrationality for most people at least some of the time, in which members of conflict-ridden communities subscribe to a higher consensus. The following quote by a journalist working for a prestigious US paper probably summed it up best: I went to the taping of the Today Show [early on during the Games]. At the beginning of the show, I asked the weatherman Al Roker, \u201cdo you know what the pollution level of Beijing is?\u201d He said he doesn\u2019t know and it doesn\u2019t matter. The preeminent weatherman of America didn\u2019t know what the pollution level of Beijing was? This is a pretty much telling statement early on of what was to become of the Games and what it was about\u2014with all the things we had thought the Games were about.16", "I went to the taping of the Today Show [early on during the Games].
