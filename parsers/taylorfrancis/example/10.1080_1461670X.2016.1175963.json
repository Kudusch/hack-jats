To that end a questionnaire was designed, built on previous data and triangulated with the results of three simultaneously organized qualitative audience studies.

The vitality of our democracy depends on the presence of excellent journalism. Usually scholars concentrate on content and production routines as yardsticks for quality (Hansen, Neuzil, and Ward 1998; Koch 2008; Merrill 1968). But being present is insufficient; excellent journalism should also be read, watched or listened to in order to impact on democracy. Prompted by the crisis in the newspaper industry and the emergence of new digital platforms and devices, interest in audience studies has been growing. Web metrics even make it possible for journalists to follow in real-time people\u2019s interest in their work, enabling a new yardstick for journalists\u2019 professional competence. On the flip side, as Tandoc and Thomas (2015) and Welbers et al. (2015) suggest, Web metrics show a disproportionate interest of users in soft news (entertainment, sports, crime, etc.). Editors\u2019 and journalists\u2019 increasing audience responsiveness could then just as easily lead to a trivialization of news, which in turn may endanger our democratic society.", "Groot Kormelink and Costera Meijer (2016) argue that Web metrics are limited instruments to measure users\u2019 interests. Clicks may refer to interest, but also to other motives, while, vice versa, absence of clicks may indicate lack of interest, but it may also mean that users get enough information out of the lead. Also, by scrolling over, browsing or scanning the news, people may be updated about important events, without clicking on the news.", "To make sense of people\u2019s own considerations regarding news use, journalism scholars often employ (a version of) the so-called Uses and Gratifications approach (U&G). This theory explains why individuals choose to use a particular medium or genre by looking at the gratifications they expect and gain from them (for an overview, see Ruggiero 2000). U&G research has identified many gratifications over the past 60 years by employing the classic two-step methodological approach of focus groups followed by surveys. In our research we took issue with Sundar and Limperos\u2019 (2013) observation that U&G researchers recently tend to dispense with the focus groups in addition to relying heavily on standardized questionnaires and broad categories (Kaye and Johnson 2002). We returned to the two-step approach and combined the strengths of survey data with the richness of in-depth interviews. Additionally, instead of equaling the main gratification factor of news\u2014the need for information/surveillance\u2014with keeping up with important events and incidents occurring in one\u2019s immediate surroundings (Eveland, Shah, and Kwak 2003; Vincent and Basil 1997), we asked news users what counts as important for them and which developments need surveillance. This open approach was also taken with regard to the factor of social utility; the usefulness of information in interpersonal communication and social and political orientation. We asked users which information they experienced as useful for interpersonal or public connection. Subsequently, we discussed the implications of these user needs for journalists and journalistic organizations.", "The need for more insight into the audiences\u2019 use, needs and desires regarding news\u2014and thus for a revised and updated U&G survey instrument\u2014is felt most urgently among scholars and producers of regional and local news. In Western Europe, regional and local broadcasters and newspapers are losing a larger share of viewers and readers and at a faster rate than national newspapers and broadcasters (Barnett 2011; Franklin and Murphy 2005; Kik and Landman 2013). Dutch regional newspapers\u2019 quality is increasingly suffering from budget cuts (Buijs 2014), while regional public broadcasters\u2019 budgets more or less remained constant. Dutch regional public broadcasters, however, suffered from changes in broadcast channels. Unlike the BBC regional news, their Dutch counterparts operate more autonomously on a separate channel. To suggest how to improve both commercial and public news organizations\u2019 performance without extra budget, we focused our research in particular on users of regional news. In this paper we focus on two broadcasters situated in Zuid-Holland, serving the most densely populated and most industrialized region of the Netherlands with 1271 residents per km2 (CBS 2014). They supply daily news on various platforms\u2014television, radio, news sites, news apps and various social media accounts\u2014and we wondered whether they met the needs and desires of their audience, potentially consisting of over 3.5 million residents.", "Previous research suggests that audiences appreciate a wider selection of news topics, a more engaging presentation, a constructive approach and tone of voice, in particular, but not exclusively, in relation to regional news (Aldridge 2007; Costera Meijer 2010, 2013b; Costera Meijer et al. 2010; Heider, McCombs, and Poindexter 2005; Poindexter, Heider, and McCombs 2006; Rosenstiel et al. 2007). In addition to general benchmarks that apply to all good journalism\u2014trustworthiness, credibility and good storytelling\u2014seven criteria were identified which should be met in particular (again, not exclusively) by regional journalism if it aims to provide news that citizens deem valuable and important.", "Compared to most content-analysis, the measures for \u201cValuable Journalism\u201d were neither derived from an a priori concept of informed citizenship which emphasizes news about public affairs, nor from citizens\u2019 opinions about quality journalism. Rather, they pertain to when and how people experience journalism as valuable. These experiences were captured in previous research by asking people to supply concrete examples of when they felt regional journalism was valuable to them (Costera Meijer 2010; Costera Meijer, Kreemers, and Ilievski 2013; Costera Meijer et al. 2010). This happened, for instance, when they were truly captivated by what they saw, read or heard, or when a news item increased their understanding of a complex issue or when it gave rise to conversations. Also, users suggest some topics should be provided more often if news organizations wanted them to watch, listen or read the news more frequently. The following criteria proved especially relevant in a regional context. What people defined as regional was not fixed, however. When we asked people in 132 intercept street interviews to draw a circle on a map of what they felt belonged to their region, these circles varied, depending on their feelings of connection to a particular space, for some a neighborhood for others a province. Local and regional news media should devote sustained attention to long-term regional themes and preferably in a constructive manner (cf. Rosenstiel et al. 2007). Stories which show new perspectives or solutions on regional issues are especially welcome.Residents value items that facilitate regional orientation by visualizing everyday geographical, social and personal landmarks: central squares, prominent bridges, highways, public gardens, nature reserves, regional and local celebrities.Citizens want to know how individual stories are related to other or previous stories (links and context). This enables them to experience coherence, not only in the news, but in (the reported) reality as well.What citizens want is for news organizations to tell news stories \u201cfrom within\u201d\u2014from the angle of the \u201clocals\u201d and their concerns (Costera Meijer 2010). This often applies in particular to background stories about a region or city that make it more understandable and familiar for those who work and live there. This information should not be confused with city branding or region marketing. Telling stories from within also contributes to a sense of collective memory, a \u201ctime line\u201d, allowing residents to position their life and that of others within the region (Assmann and Czaplicka 1995).Providing insight into the regional customs or local manners is relevant for understanding how things work. Schudson (1995, 31) argued in this context that journalists do not so much produce information, but \u201cpublic knowledge\u201d. They contribute to \u201cwhat is recognized or accepted\u2009\u2009\u2026\u2009\u2009given certain political structures and traditions\u201d.A side-effect of biased, sensationalized regional news for the people who actually work or live in the region is sometimes experienced as losing one\u2019s grip on everyday reality; a reason why residents want to be given a layered and \u201crealist\u201d representation of their region, leaving room for the complexities, ambivalences and contradictions of everyday lived reality. It is important to note that even residents from so-called urban problem areas are univocal in emphasizing that supplying only positive news may just as well lead to a sense of losing contact with reality (Costera Meijer 2013b).Most people love so-called talker news items which often focus on relatively bizarre or human-interest news topics. Such \u201cnews\u201d proves valuable because it facilitates (brief) conversations between relative strangers, thus strengthening people\u2019s feeling of belonging and connection.", "Local and regional news media should devote sustained attention to long-term regional themes and preferably in a constructive manner (cf.

In this paper we focus on the results of the audience survey. In previous audience studies we were regularly confronted with harsh judgements about regional and local journalism, such as \u201cI never watch the regional news; it\u2019s all about rescuing cats from trees or about neighbors arguing about the height of their fence\u201d. Such statements usually came from higher-educated people with limited or no experience of it. They might reflect a point of Bourdieu (1984), that the culturally privileged feel they have \u201cthe right to speak\u201d and pass judgement even without personal knowledge of a genre, while those with less cultural capital tend to reserve their opinions for genres they have actually used (cf. Friedman and Kuipers 2013). Because we were interested in peoples\u2019 experience of value instead of their opinions about value, we purposely selected actual users of regional journalism. Consequently, these users are not a representative sample of the population. The validity of the survey and the generalizability of the results are enhanced because our survey respondents turned out to be a representative sample of the actual users of regional news (CBS 2015).", "Although our survey propositions are strongly grounded in qualitative research, we agree with Lowrey, Brozana, and Mackay (2008) that what counts as \u201cregion\u201d is not only a question of geography but also one of negotiating shared symbolic meanings. The studied region has a multicultural urban character which invites further calibration of the instrument when used to measure the value of national journalism or more rural areas.", "Of the two (almost identical) surveys announced on the news websites of the broadcasters, their Twitter accounts as well as on their Facebook pages, 539 filled-out surveys resulted. We removed 169 from our sample because respondents had addressed fewer than six questions, implying that we analyzed the remaining 370 surveys for this study.", "Our sample (see Table 1) consisted of a fairly large proportion of men, people over 50 and people with higher education. This is consistent with previous results (Van Cauwenberge et al. 2010; Dutta-Bergman 2004; Elvestad and Blekesaune 2008; Lauf 2001; Van Rees and Van Eijck 2003). On average, people in these groups consume more regional and local news. Valuable JournalismMeasuring news quality from a user\u2019s perspectiveAll authorsIrene Costera Meijer & Hildebrand P.

We asked respondents to evaluate them on a five-point Likert scale. To establish whether Valuable Journalism as a separate concept constitutes a single dimension in the experience of people, we started out with a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) in R with Lavaan (Rosseel 2012), whereby one factor explained the response patterns for all 20 items. This model did not meet the required model fit measures,1 after which we deployed Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), interpreted after Oblimin rotation, to establish which items formed specific dimensions together.2 Based on this we generated a new CFA model, from which in a step-by-step progression items were removed based on their beta coefficients and the modification index, until this model had an acceptable fit (see Table 2). Next, the model was modified to include a latent higher-order variable representing the overall experience of Valuable Journalism.

There appears to be a strong internal correlation between seemingly divergent needs (Cronbach\u2019s alpha\u2009=\u20090.840). Users do not only expect media to supply the news right after it happens; they also like to be able to easily find news once something of importance occurs. Second, urgency, to users, does not only apply to important news, but also to major public events in the region. Events like the annual flower parade and international concours hippique might not be new in the sense of unexpected, but they are important as common reference points. Moreover, broadcasters need to indicate clearly where, exactly, events take place. These matters go together in the experience of urgency.", "Couldry, Livingstone, and Markham (2007, 405) explain \u201cpublic connection\u201d as a shared \u201corientation to a public world where matters of common concern are, or at least should be, addressed\u201d.

Our study reveals that background is a distinct construct, measured by \u201cproviding insight into the customs and attitudes of the different population groups living in the region\u201d, \u201cproviding insight into how the region works\u201d as well as \u201cinto the past of the region\u201d.

Urgency also refers to findability in connection to the platform as well as to the location of the event. This may reflect the importance of media\u2019s ease of use. Second, public connection stands out as the linking concept between respectfulness, a constructive approach and supplying serious as well as light conversation topics. This might illustrate the importance of regional journalism for keeping up personal networks as well as people\u2019s identity as citizens.", "Our third suggestion is that the centrality of understanding the region within Valuable Journalism mirrors people\u2019s awareness of news as second-order reality; they know about others and others know about them in as far as and how they appear through news stories. Although Coleman et al. (2009) suggest people having direct personal experience with an issue usually do not need more information from the media, our respondents explicitly refer to a need for news about familiar topics, often not because they lack information, but because it enables them to compare their own experience of events with that of others. This comparison accommodates a need for a common frame of reference. Fourth, audience responsiveness is likely to mirror the growing assertiveness of the public. News media are expected to take into account and to listen carefully to the experiences of people of all walks of life, in interpersonal communication as well as in their stories.", "Fifth, our respondents indicate they would increase their news use when journalism covered more thoroughly and extensively the seven news themes and, in particular, nature, living environment and history. Remarkably, these three subject areas are usually absent as conventional newsbeats, even in research on local journalism (cf. Rosenstiel et al. 2007, 2014). Finally, Valuable Journalism as a layered concept may lend itself as a framework for evaluating the performance of news organizations from the public\u2019s perspective, in particular for news organizations operating in densely populated, urban areas with a continuously changing population."]}], "references": [{"title": "Collective Memory and Cultural Identity", "year": "1995", "journal":
