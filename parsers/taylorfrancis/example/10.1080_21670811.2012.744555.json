In this era of all-digital media, where Negroponte\u2019s \u201cbits commingle effortlessly\u201d (1995, 18), interactivity and the confluence of online news and social media give rise to both challenge and opportunity (Braun and Gillespie 2011).", "From multimedia to social media, the preponderance of digital technology in today\u2019s news work has the potential both to shift and reinforce journalists\u2019 traditional norms and practices (Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton 2012; Deuze and Marjoribanks 2009). Of growing interest is the role of the information network Twitter in news reporting. Having garnered attention for its significance during natural disasters, political uprisings, and other breaking news (Hermida, Lewis, and Zamith 2012; Murthy 2011; Project for Excellence in Journalism 2011), Twitter has been heralded as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for newsrooms, with \u201cthe power to connect reporters and sources, as well as readers, like never before\u201d (Hacker and Seshagiri 2011). Active participation by journalists and citizens in the digital universe may be facilitating a shift in conventions and cultures (An et al. 2011), moving away from the tradition of journalism as \u201clecture by professional authorities,\u201d toward public dialogue, or \u201ca new way of knowing\u201d (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2010, 7). This \u201cnext journalism,\u201d argue Kovach and Rosenstiel (2010, 175), must shift away from journalism as product, toward more of a service\u2014which can answer citizens\u2019 questions, and provide them with tools and resources.", "This study examines US newspaper reporters\u2019 use of Twitter within Kovach and Rosenstiel\u2019s \u201cnext journalism\u201d framework, drawing from their \u201cessential dimensions\u201d that define journalism as service or dialogue (2010, 175). The functions explored include the reporter as: \u201csmart aggregator\u201d (179), \u201cwitness bearer\u201d (177), \u201cempowerer\u201d (178) and \u201cforum organizer\u201d (180), as measures of service and public dialogue. The research question asks: Are reporters on Twitter adhering to the conventions of journalism as lecture and product, or are they engaging in journalism as service and public dialogue?"]}, {"title": "Twitter and Journalism", "paragraphs": ["From the first public tweet dispatched in March 2006, \u201cjust setting up my twttr\u201d (Wauters 2012), Twitter has grown from a side project (Williams 2009) to an information network that is \u201caffecting the way news is gathered, disseminated, and consumed\u201d (Hermida 2012, 2). Pew Research Center\u2019s Project for Excellence in Journalism tracks Twitter news content in its New Media Index (Journalism.org 2012). Surveys show the majority of journalists use Twitter in their work (Oriella 2011; Cision 2010). And mainstream news media are attracting large numbers of followers on Twitter; some exceeding their circulation numbers. The New York Times print edition, for example, has a daily circulation of about 780,000 (Lulofs 2012) and more than six million Twitter followers. 1  ", "The 2011 launch of Twitter for Newsrooms  2  attracted attention in the digital media community, which noted its significance for journalism, \u201cthe fact that Twitter has launched an official guide for journalists is indicative of the impact of social media on the news\u201d (Ehrlich 2011). And within a week of that launch, the first presidential town hall on Twitter engaged journalists who were seasoned Twitter users to help flag questions from their communities (Klapper 2011). A subsequent best practices guide highlights Twitter\u2019s own research, suggesting journalists use @mentions and share what they are reading to increase followers and engagement (Luckie 2012).", "Other developments signal an integration of Twitter into newswork. For example, the Boston Globe displays newsroom staff tweets on a Twitter board\u2014a large monitor in a high-traffic area of its city room\u2014and plans to add more throughout the Globe\u2019s newsrooms (Marstall 2011). It is seen as an \u201cupdated take on newsroom screens and data feeds from another era\u2014TVs, police scanners, centrally-located teletypes, etc.\u201d The New York Times offers an online directory of its reporters who use Twitter and showcases featured accounts at the top of the page (nytimes 2012). And newspapers are reaching out to readers for feedback on social media as part of the Associated Press Managing Editors Social Media Credibility Project (Lail 2011).", "As the news industry integrates social media into its daily operations, a body of scholarly research on Twitter and news work is emerging. An analysis of 500 journalists found their Twitter use to \u201cvary widely,\u201d yet identified emergent patterns and trends (Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton 2012, 30). Journalists \u201cnormalize\u201d Twitter to fit existing professional norms and practices (Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton 2012), which is similar to Singer\u2019s (2005) findings on journalist bloggers. Yet, in some instances, journalists on Twitter deviate from professional conventions, more freely expressing opinions, and retweeting and linking to \u201copen the gates to non-professional participants in the news production process\u201d (Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton 2012, 31). This resonates with the idea that the \u201cpecking order of traditional gatekeeping is irrelevant to a Twitter audience\u201d (Blasingame 2011, 17). Other changes in journalistic conventions and cultures include active participation on Twitter (An et al. 2011; Sheffer and Schultz 2010).", "While technology can provide an infrastructure to enable information flow, capture, and meaning-making (Boczkowski 2009), it can also serve as a distribution platform. Thirteen major news organizations used Twitter primarily to disseminate their own material (Holcomb, Gross, and Mitchell 2011). Of the more than 3600 tweets examined, 93 percent linked to the organizations\u2019 own content. Another study of nearly 500 local US television stations found little facilitation of interactivity between the stations and their Twitter followers (Greer and Ferguson 2011).", "So, while we see evidence of the mainstream news industry adopting Twitter, the scholarly literature shows its use and integration into news work as mixed. Within Kovach and Rosenstiel\u2019s (2010) \u201cnext journalism\u201d framework, news media that link predominantly to their own content appear to be adhering to the tradition of journalism as product and lecture, while others, who engage in active participation with citizens, might be viewed as moving toward public dialogue and service."]}, {"title": "Journalism and the Public Dialogue", "paragraphs": ["Anderson, Dardenne, and Killenberg (1996, 161) warn that \u201cjournalism cannot afford to operate as a mere transmission apparatus for traditional news.\u201d They argue for the conversational commons, where news is not commodity, but is instead, \u201ca co-creation of journalists and the people of the community\u201d (165). The news industry is recognizing Twitter as a platform for such interaction. The Knight Digital Media Center views Twitter as, \u201ca way to keep a pulse on and engage with communities, locate sources, and to report on the world [sic] new and unique ways\u201d (Hacker and Seshagiri 2011). Hermida (2010) describes Twitter as an awareness system, not only for breaking news, but which can alert journalists to trends or issues. He defines Twitter\u2019s linked content as a means for creating a shared conversation. And TV stations are embracing social media, having conversations with the audience (Papper 2011). But the degree of interaction varies widely among individual journalists and their organizations. Among 80 media sources on Twitter, journalists were five times more likely than media organizations to respond to mentions posted by the audience (An et al. 2011).", "In contemporary online media, journalists commonly perceive the medium allowing a closer relationship with the audience\u2014a compressed social distance (Schmitz Weiss and de Macedo Higgins Joyce 2009).", "Marwick and boyd (2010, 16) describe Twitter as \u201can example of a technology with a \u2018networked audience.\u2019\u201d While the faceless, mass, broadcast audience has limited opportunity for feedback, the networked audience can communicate in a \u201c\u2018many to many\u2019 model\u201d (Marwick and boyd 2010, 16). Huberman, Romero, and Wu (2009) differentiate between what they call friends on Twitter\u2014those who communicate using direct messages to individuals\u2014and communicating via tweets to an entire network of followers."]}, {"title": "Exploring Journalism as Service and Public Dialogue on Twitter", "paragraphs": ["Kovach and Rosenstiel\u2019s call for journalism of service and public dialogue guides this study\u2019s analysis of reporter tweets. It draws from four of their eight \u201cessential dimensions\u201d that define \u201cjournalism as service or dialogue\u201d (2010, 175). They include the \u201csmart aggregator\u201d (179), \u201cwitness bearer\u201d (177), \u201cempowerer\u201d (178), and \u201cforum organizer\u201d (180). The additional four dimensions\u2014\u201cauthenticator\u201d (175), \u201csense maker\u201d (176), \u201cinvestigator\u201d (177), and \u201crole model\u201d (181)\u2014are highly relevant, but measuring them would involve a different methodology and goes beyond the scope of this study.", "While the field of journalism includes a wide range of jobs and specializations with varying work practices, this study focuses exclusively on the Twitter streams of reporters. By making this distinction, it narrows the examination to those involved in the newsgathering process, which includes contact with sources and the potential for communicating with the public.", "From a reporter\u2019s own story to a humorous YouTube video, linked content transcends the 140-character limit in the Twitter feed through a click of the mouse or a tap of the finger. In the context of the public dialogue, links on Twitter can be viewed as a \u201cform of data sharing and as a system for creating a shared conversation\u201d (Hermida 2010, 303). Within the context of the Kovach and Rosenstiel model (2010, 180), linking could be used to measure the smart aggregator function: \u201cSmart aggregators should share sources they rely on, the stories they find illuminating, the information that informed them.\u201d", "What links do reporters include in their tweets? Are they primarily URLs that link to their own stories and newsroom content? This practice, which may be required by news operations, would illustrate adherence to the traditional lecture model described by Kovach and Rosenstiel, with journalists essentially \u201ctelling the public what it should know\u201d through their own product (2010, 175). However, linking to other news outlets\u2019 coverage, government websites, documents, and other content could be viewed as more of a smart aggregator approach. Twitter\u2019s best practices encourage reporters to share what they are reading to increase engagement, \u201cmix it up a bit: when individuals share URLs to non-company sources, they experience a bump in follows\u201d (Luckie 2012).", "To explore the smart aggregator function among journalists on Twitter, this study examines the linked content in reporters\u2019 tweets. Linking to material generated outside their own news organizations would offer evidence for the smart aggregator function.", "The smart aggregator can also be measured through retweets. Retweeting allows users to resend another\u2019s message to their own network of followers. The percentage of retweets documented in several studies have ranged in average from 3 percent (Zhang, Fuehres, and Gloor 2009; boyd, Golder, and Lotan 2010) to 19 percent (Tumasjan et al. 2010). More than half of American Twitter users retweet material posted by others (Smith and Rainie 2010). Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton (2012) found journalists retweeting 15 percent of messages studied, suggesting a sharing of the traditional media gatekeeping role. In addition, the retweeted message has great power to reach large audiences, as shown in an examination of 106 million tweets, which found that retweets reached an average of 1000 users, regardless of the number of followers of the original tweet (Kwak et al. 2010).", "Leavitt et al. (2009, 7) argue that retweets occur \u201cbecause a user is influenced to reproduce the content.\u201d It follows that if reporters largely retweet messages from their own newsrooms, they would be highlighting their product, while retweeting outside content would indicate a shift toward the smart aggregator. As with links, reporters\u2019 retweets will be examined to determine what they are retweeting.", "By simply showing up to bear witness to events, journalists serve the public through their monitoring function (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2010). In the context of Twitter, reporters can serve this role through live coverage of meetings, events, and breaking news. While real-time reporting is not new, live tweeting involves a networked audience, which has not been the case for live broadcast radio and television news reporting. To what extent are reporters live tweeting news, what are they covering, and how are they doing so? The study addresses the question through the frequency of live tweeting and a qualitative analysis of the live tweets.", "What role do reporters\u2019 sources play in journalism as service and the public dialogue on Twitter? Whose statements or opinions are they quoting and retweeting? According to Schudson (1989), official sources dominate the news. At the national, state, and local level, Schudson writes, \u201cthe story of journalism, on a day-to-day basis, is the story of the interaction of reporters and officials\u201d (14). And journalists regularly quote and adopt the language of politicians and officials (Lewis and Reese 2009). Is this the case on Twitter? Considering the interactivity of this medium, are reporters holding to the traditional official sourcing conventions, or are they expanding to include more citizen sources? A case study of NPR journalist Andy Carvin\u2019s tweets during the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions found substantial numbers of tweets from non-elite sources during key periods of the uprisings, even though mainstream media and other elite sources made up three-fourths of his sources (Hermida, Lewis, and Zamith 2012).", "The present study explores sourcing and pursues further questions regarding reporter as empowerer. With whom are reporters communicating on Twitter? What percentage of tweets are @mentions (quasi-private) and to whom are reporters directing these tweets? And, because Twitter is a social network, are the messages sent in the context of news work, or a more general framework?", "While the print media helped create this model through letters to the editor and op-eds (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2010), can it be extended through Twitter? Are reporters reaching out to the public, inviting discourse on Twitter? If so, which beats are more likely to reach out to the public, asking for information, reaction, or comments? Or, are reporters simply trolling for sources? Quantitative and qualitative analyses address these questions."]}, {"title": "Method", "paragraphs": ["This study used constructed-week sampling to identify and collect reporter Twitter content. The researcher drew a sample of 2733 tweets from metro reporters listed on the website MuckRack. 3  MuckRack\u2019s compilation of journalists on Twitter has served as a research source for sampling journalists who use the social network (Lasorsa 2012; Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton 2012).", "Reporters were drawn from the 51 US metro daily newspapers in the \u201csource\u201d listing on MuckRack (subsequently listed as publication).

Politicians appeared in quotes 12 times more often than citizens (57 versus 18 percent, respectively). And, a full three-quarters of the quotes featured politicians or public employees.", "To explore whether the politics beat may have overly represented the number of official sources in the quotes, the researcher ran a follow-up frequency test excluding tweets from politics reporters. It also found substantial quoting of politicians and government employees (66 percent). So, even without the tweets sent by politics reporters, the findings showed two-thirds of quotes came from official government sources.", "Returning to the data as a whole\u2014while citizens were quoted relatively infrequently, they did account for the greatest percentage of @mentions (38 percent), followed by journalists (24 percent). It is important to note that twice as many @mentions were unrelated to reporting (67 percent) than were related to reporting (33 percent), suggesting that reporters may have been messaging friends and acquaintances as well as citizen followers.", "Reporters publicly asked questions of their followers in only 1.6 percent of their tweets. Nine out of ten questions were either general, or asked for feedback or verification. The other 10 percent invited followers to contact the reporter as a story source. Some asked sources to contact them directly, while others made the conversation public by retweeting followers\u2019 @mentions for all to see.

However, at the same time, conventions of the analog media persist in the digital realm, leaning toward what Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton (2012) have labeled as \u201cnormalizing Twitter.\u201d What we see, then, melds a conversational commons (Anderson, Dardenne, and Killenberg 1996), with journalism as \u201clecture by professional authorities\u201d (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2010). The reporters studied convey news to consumers as the product of individual news organizations, while also serving citizens by tweeting their beats and sharing information originating outside their own newsrooms. They face the challenge of negotiating the networked environment amidst long-standing institutional models. But, even though news organizations may resist journalism-as-service, its practice on Twitter may enhance the value of their offerings. As Twitter\u2019s own research illustrates, journalists increase engagement and followers by using @mentions to cite sources, by live tweeting, and sharing links to others\u2019 content (Luckie 2012).", "Through live tweeting, reporters bear witness by monitoring government and institutions, and covering breaking news as it unfolds. Nearly one-third of the tweets studied were from live news coverage, including trials, government proceedings, school board meetings, crime, and other breaking news. Simply showing up \u201cprovides democracy with a life-ensuring sunshine by its very presence\u201d (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2010, 178). In addition, the reporters questioned and clarified potential misinformation, and provided context by linking to photos and other multimedia elements. While journalist-as-witness-bearer is not new, reporting live in a networked environment is still evolving. As this study showed, reporters facilitated discourse and empowered the public to be part of the news process during this live coverage. The bulk of @mentions reporters sent while live tweeting went to citizens, suggesting that the journalists were both responding to followers who had information to share and to those who asked questions about the breaking events. In some cases, reporters opened up the conversation by retweeting @mentions from their followers, sharing them with everyone on Twitter.", "Reporters who retweeted messages and links originating outside their own papers emulated the smart aggregator function called for by Kovach and Rosenstiel, in which journalists patrol the Web and share helpful information: \u201cThe idea of the \u2018walled garden,\u2019 in which a news organization offers only its own reporting, is over. For a news organization to be really helpful, \u2026 it must also point its audience to other Web sources that it considers valuable\u201d (2010, 179). The present study supported this concept, finding reporters\u2019 retweets to other content significantly greater than to their own newsroom content. While it may appear counterintuitive to share others\u2019 content, this approach has the potential to enhance value and build followers, as suggested by Twitter\u2019s research (Luckie 2012), making service good for business.", "But the findings also revealed adherence to the conventions of news as product and the dominance of official sources in reporting. Reporters essentially promote their own stories and their newspapers\u2019 website content through links on Twitter. And while that content can be part of smart aggregators\u2019 Twitter streams, the challenge lies in striking a balance between links to their own pieces and other useful information. In some cases, that may mean complying with organizational practices outside reporters\u2019 control. While this study found the majority of links to reporters\u2019 own newsroom content, the figure is substantially lower than the 93 percent found in research on major news organization\u2019s Twitter feeds (Holcomb, Gross, and Mitchell 2011). The official organizations\u2019 feeds may serve primarily as a dissemination platform while the individual reporters\u2019 Twitter accounts, as examined in the present study, provide alternative content as well.", "Another journalistic convention this study identified on Twitter is the reliance on official sources. While Hermida, Lewis, and Zamith (2012) found alternative sources influencing the content of Andy Carvin\u2019s Twitter account, this study found sourcing patterns that primarily reflect interactions among reporters and officials (Schudson 1989; Lewis and Reese 2009). Politicians were quoted in tweets 12 times more often than citizens, and along with government employees, accounted for 75 percent of quotes. Even after excluding the politics beat from the analysis, these official sources appeared in two-thirds of quotes, indicating that the storytelling structure built on official sources and quotes appears to prevail within the confines of the 140-character tweet. But this does not mean reporters are ignoring citizen voices on Twitter. When we take into account retweets, a slightly different picture emerges. Reporters retweeted @mentions from citizens nearly as often as from official sources and facilitated networked conversations by making those conversations public. And, with each retweet having the potential to reach 1000 people (Kwak et al. 2010), even modest numbers of citizen voices may be making meaningful contributions to the public dialogue, helped along by the reporters who are distributing those tweets.", "This study\u2019s focus on the most-followed metro newspaper reporters on Twitter is distinct from others that have included news organizations and various types of journalists in their analyses. This strength may also be seen as a limitation, as its findings might not be generalizable to all journalists on Twitter. News operations, reporters with fewer followers, and journalists from broadcast, magazine, Web-only, or other organizations may use the network differently. Specific country or regional differences may also be notable, as well as individual or organizational characteristics.", "While this content analysis and others provide evidence for patterns and practices among reporters on Twitter, perceptions, process, and context await exploration. Future studies might employ survey research to investigate what enables or impedes the move toward public dialogue and service among reporters on Twitter. In addition to the four functions used in this study, future research might also draw from Kovach and Rosenstiel\u2019s (2010) authenticator, sense maker, investigator, and role model dimensions. And further content analyses might focus on specific beats on Twitter across media."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Evidence of a shift toward service and public dialogue can be seen in the reporters\u2019 Twitter feeds examined in this research. Smart aggregators are sharing links to content originating outside their own newsrooms in addition to their own, providing extra value to their followers. By live tweeting, reporters are bearing witness to events, serving the public as monitor and even watchdog. And while live reporting has been an essential journalistic function for decades, never before have reporters done so within a network where citizens, officials, and journalists together can contribute to the pursuit of truth. By using @mentions, reporters communicate with citizens, and show evidence of an empowering function by retweeting those messages. And their calls for participation go beyond simply trolling for sources.", "While the data offer evidence for a \u201cnew way of knowing\u201d (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2010), they also exhibit adherence to conventions of journalism as lecture and product, and \u201cnormalizing Twitter\u201d (Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton 2012). The role of Twitter as another dissemination platform for legacy media is evidenced by the majority of URLs that link to reporters\u2019 stories and their own newsroom content. And the long-standing dominance of official sources can be seen in tweets that heavily quote politicians and public employees.", "Judging from the tweet streams studied, reporters on Twitter are providing a service to citizens.
