Observations in newsrooms and 40 interviews with journalists from eight major news organisations in the United Kingdom and Canada highlight three significant changes: (1) shifts in traditional news flow cycles; (2) heightened accountability; and (3) evolving news values. Rising public documentation via mobile phones inserts a new element into traditional news flow cycles while material from bloggers acting as \u201ccitizen journalists\u201d occasionally aids reporting of contested topics or regions fraught with accessibility issues. Elevated public scrutiny also obliges news organisations to contend with increasingly effective flak-producers. Some journalists have modified their daily routines to reflect the opportunities enabled by new media but altered organisational notions of immediacy significantly constrain time spent gathering the news, particularly within 24-hour programmes. Largely as a means of securing audiences, organisations are turning to their websites to offer interactivity and transparency. ", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The value of exploring the impact of new media on both journalism practice and public behaviours is rooted in an awareness that actions of both journalists and the wider public intertwine and can become influential in the production of mainstream news. Since this research area is inevitably wide, with governments, industry and their associated PR agents also acting to influence news content, this article concentrates on the perspectives of journalists. Newsroom observations and 40 face-to-face interviews with journalists from eight major news organisations in the United Kingdom and Canada1 are used to illustrate how individual journalists and their organisations are adapting to the unique circumstances enabled by new media.", "The strength of new media within the public domain rests in its evolution towards cheaper, more mobile and widely accessible technologies. Yet mere availability is not sufficient to alter the media landscape within which journalists work. The creation of a new technological device does not ensure its success nor do consumers necessarily use devices in ways intended by developers. Furthermore, the more substantial developments currently influencing journalism are largely extensions of public behaviours that had existed without the enabling technology (Kline and Burstein, 2005) but operated in a less visible and influential way. For example, audience interaction with news organisations was once limited to written letters or phone calls but has expanded to include e-mail, text and an abundance of online options. As well, free online publishing tools have enabled the growth of a blogosphere essentially mass broadcast, containing opinions and commentary that otherwise may have only been accessible to a few\u2014via small-scale circulations, personal communication, diaries, etc.\u2014or may never have escaped the minds of many who now choose to openly publish their thoughts. Since these new tools enable the potential for boundless discussion2 among the public, engagement with new media by news organisations \u201cholds the promise of a better, more efficient, more democratic medium for journalism and the public\u201d (Pavlik, 2001, p. xiii). At the same time, however, information overload inevitably leads to filtering and potential group polarisation of views, both of which fragment audiences and contradict the democratising function supposedly inherent within new media. This is because democracy is dependent upon citizens being \u201cexposed to materials that they would not have chosen in advance\u201d and many or most having \u201ca range of common experiences\u201d (Sunstein, 2001, pp. 8\u20139). However, predicting the long-term impact of new media on democracy is not the aim of this paper. Instead, analysis focuses on the means through which journalists and news organisations are adapting their practice to reflect the possibilities enabled by new media.", "Three significant transformations are highlighted: (1) shifts in traditional news flow cycles; (2) heightened accountability; and (3) evolving news values. Developments within the public realm relevant to these adaptations include: mobile phone picture and video recording at the scene of a news event and subsequent transmission to news organisations; publishing original news reports, news analysis and commentary via publicly accessible blogs; and online criticisms of mainstream news output complete with video \u201cevidence\u201d that greatly enhance flak-producing campaigns. Relevant developments within the realm of journalism include: electronic transmission of news agency feeds; organisational adaptations to the volume of images received from the public; occasional incorporation of blog content into news output, particularly within the online section of converged newsrooms; experimentation with professional journalist blogs; technologies expanding \u201clive\u201d coverage; and engagement with interactive functions of new media.", "The research design for this project involved a focus on production within television news organisations, which ultimately also encompassed associated online activities. Therefore it is the body of production research that this project has sought to expand in light of new media developments. News production research has typically privileged the constraining factors that influence the final news bulletin to the detriment of those factors that facilitate agency within the daily practice of journalism. This analytical focus began with gatekeeper studies that considered only the initial process of selection, which most researchers depicted as subjective and determined by individual preferences (Flegel and Chaffee, 1971; Snider, 1967; Warner, 1970; White, 1950). Research soon developed into more inclusive studies determined to expose news as a social construction and in so doing focused attention on the routines of production and hence the predictability of most news coverage (Epstein, 1973; Fishman, 1980; Gans, 1980; Gitlin, 1980; Golding and Elliott, 1979; Schlesinger, 1987; Sigelman, 1973; Tuchman, 1978). These relatively stable routines were analysed within the framework of structural constraints and thus everything from the daily news conference and the \u201ctrickling down\u201d of policy to rampant professional ideologies, newsroom cultures and logistic-centric decision-making were viewed as limitations on news output. Since this explosion of production studies, most research has continued in the same analytical direction (Harrison, 2000; MacGregor, 1997), with less attention to the agency periodically secured by journalists despite this overarching system of internal and external constraints. A journalist's position determines the level of accessible autonomy yet what is most interesting here is the bulk of journalists whose greatest opportunities to exercise agency occur after story assignment (e.g. choosing resources to browse and selecting sources to quote). These decisions are a necessary part of the production process and can have a significant impact on news content, despite what are often rigid instructions from superiors regarding preferred story angles, internalised notions of which approaches to news content are most desirable by the organisation as a whole, and attempts to achieve professionalised notions of impartiality and objectivity (Tuchman, 1972, p. 668).", "McNair's (2006) recent exposition of research in this area supports the conclusion that academics continue to overemphasise constraints and largely dismiss any anomalous findings despite the need to engage with today's emerging political, economic, ideological and technological environments (hence his suggestion to shift from a \u201ccontrol paradigm\u201d to a \u201cchaos paradigm\u201d). According to McNair (2006), p. 4), the balance of power is shifting, leading to a weakened capacity of elite groups to influence news agendas. Considering the capacity of bloggers to sporadically influence news agendas, there may be some validity to his claim but any perceived shift is only slight and elite groups are adapting hastily and will likely continue to find ways of shaping news output. Therefore, apart from elite groups, this research exposes those developments within the public realm enabled by new media that act as catalysts for transformations within journalistic practice. In so doing, the adaptations individual journalists can make to their daily routines are considered in relation to traditional constraining factors. Journalists do not necessarily embrace whatever level of agency they perceive to have and attempt to improve their news gathering by, for instance, engaging with more voices through the outlets now provided by new media, but if they are not organisationally constrained from doing so it is important that researchers question why they choose not to."]}, {"title": "News Flow Cycles", "paragraphs": ["The routines of news production are dependent upon the consistent flow of potentially newsworthy items from the \u201cinformation-producing strata\u201d (Golding and Elliott, 1979, p. 169) of society. This strata most often translates into government officials and industry spokespeople, but generally refers to those individuals or groups that produce information specifically geared towards inclusion in mainstream news output. Traditionally, economic imperatives driving production processes led to the domination of news agencies over news flow since sending foreign correspondents easily surpassed agency subscription costs (Golding and Elliott, 1979, p. 104). With the Internet offering platforms for a greater assortment of prospective actors in the \u201cinformation-producing strata\u201d, the prior role of \u201cstringers\u201d is expanded in new ways while the addition of \u201ccitizen journalists\u201d invokes credibility issues, with assessments becoming increasingly convoluted. Escalating public documentation of events and greater acceptance of \u201cnon-professional\u201d video and images by news organisations has also altered news flow patterns. Therefore, a wider variety of actors can direct news agendas while citizens increasingly capture the most memorable images of breaking news stories. These public behaviours have not destabilised the established role of news agencies or forced \u201cofficial\u201d voices out of news production processes, and there are no indications that they will. Still, even Reuters CEO Tom Glocer (2006) publicly accepted that news agencies \u201cno longer have a choke-hold on the flow of information\u201d.", "Normally reporters and correspondents are assigned stories on the basis of news flow cycles and coverage by other media outlets, while occasionally offering their own stories. However, the substitution of teleprinters for electronic delivery of news agency feeds has enabled greater participation in the initial selection process, displacing the traditional gatekeeping role of the lone \u201ccopy taster\u201d: \u201cWe still have copy tasters\u2014everyone is one!\u201d (Sky Executive Producer). Software packages like iNews and ENPS manage running orders and facilitate collection of news items via colour-coded or comparable ranking systems. For instance, phrases like \u201ciraq-unrest-blast\u201d appear in blinking red font in the corner of a computer screen to signify that the news item is urgent. The consequences of the change in delivery format is, on one hand, a diffusion of power over subjective notions of newsworthiness due to collective monitoring of feeds and, on the other hand, a greater control by news agencies over notions of importance attached to each item: In terms of who's rejecting and who's approving stories for publication, it's very much a democratic process within our team I think. People will spot things that I might not spot and say \u201cwhat do you think of this as a story\u201d and if the resource is there we'll say \u201cok we'll have a look at that\u201d. (Mick McGlinchey, BBC Scotland Web Editor)  ", "In terms of who's rejecting and who's approving stories for publication, it's very much a democratic process within our team I think. People will spot things that I might not spot and say \u201cwhat do you think of this as a story\u201d and if the resource is there we'll say \u201cok we'll have a look at that\u201d. (Mick McGlinchey, BBC Scotland Web Editor)", "Newsroom observations revealed that constant monitoring of feeds entails a greater potential for more \u201cexplanatory\u201d or \u201creview\u201d items to be included within news broadcasts that may not have otherwise. During the course of a day Executive Producers rarely click on an item if it is not marked \u201curgent\u201d but other journalists more readily see the constant barrage of items\u2014for instance over a particular conflict as it becomes increasingly violent\u2014regardless of whether each item is included in their organisation's broadcast. Collective monitoring leads to occasions where journalists will advocate for the inclusion of particular items, persuading their Executive Producer to, for instance, assign an item on the steady rise of violence in Iraq, including summary casualty statistics. Any potential for the inclusion of news items that might offer greater \u201cexplanation\u201d or \u201creview\u201d can only be advantageous to public understanding, but selection ultimately rests with the Executive Producer.", "The most significant development arising from the ubiquity of mobile phones is the advent of \u201cuser-generated content\u201d (UGC). The December 2004 South Asian tsunami, the 7 July 2005 attacks in London, and the December 2005 Buncefield oil depot fire are what most journalists conceive of as the beginning of UGC due to the unprecedented volume of images and video from mobile phones, e-mails, and text messages sent to news organisations.3 UGC can also refer to any material produced by the public via the Internet, ranging from online comments and forum discussions on news websites to news-related material produced and published outside of the mainstream media via websites and blogs, although the latter is often labelled \u201ccitizen journalism\u201d. What is critical about this public behavioural shift towards an explosion of UGC is that mainstream media are making space for this production within newsrooms\u2014with the BBC creating a UGC Hub\u2014and within news items: The story's not just about getting people on air and getting packages, it's about the whole kind of UGC picture as well. It's just kind of what we do now, we don't even think about it half the time. It's become like second nature\u2009\u2026\u2009So editors are wanting to do more of this. (Mariita Eager, BBC News Editor)  ", "The story's not just about getting people on air and getting packages, it's about the whole kind of UGC picture as well.

(Mariita Eager, BBC News Editor)", "On some occasions, the flood of UGC linked to a breaking news item has actually reversed the traditional flow of news, compelling news organisations to act as distributors and pass on material to news agencies and other media. This could become more significant than it first appears since news output increasingly consists of breaking news items, or \u201cevent-driven\u201d news (Lawrence, 2000). Schudson's (2005, p. 173) latest review of the sociology of news led him\u2014for the first time since 1989\u2014to remove himself from the set of academics who sought to highlight the social construction of news since \u201cthe unexpected, the dramatic, the unprecedented, even the bizarre\u201d is now more likely to be encountered by journalists than \u201cinstitution-driven\u201d news, which Schudson deems social scientists to be \u201calmost exclusive[ly] preoccupied with\u201d. While Schudson's review was likely prepared before the onslaught of UGC, an increase in \u201cevent-driven\u201d news can only be intensified by a reliable flow of UGC, particularly for broadcast journalism which is highly dependent upon good images. Online news facilitates the acquisition of UGC and hence the occasional reversal of traditional news flows: For instance, the derailment we had in Inverness at the start of the year\u2014we put a post form saying \u201cdo you know anyone who was on the train\u201d, \u201cwere you on it yourself\u201d, \u201chave you got any photographs\u201d? Within an hour we had e-mails back from people saying \u201cI know my friend was on it, they've given me their number, here you can give them a ring\u201d. So we were ringing them up, interviewing them for the website, for the radio, for television. And then it was the agencies who were taking that content and using that in terms of the reports they're putting out. So you see how things can go full circle.

This is compounded by the fact that nearly all news organisations now openly solicit UGC, although news agencies such as Reuters have also begun soliciting UGC through their online presence that in and of itself is altering their once negligible relationship with the public. BBC World News Editor Jon Williams (2006) suggests the ubiquity of digital imaging technology is an advantage: \u201cFor news\u2014as news editor\u2014it's a magnificent resource to draw on\u201d. The BBC's UGC Hub Producer, Nicola Green, also highlights the value of UGC: I mean essentially we've got stringers in every corner of the world. It's a difference between getting the picture of the explosion as it happens and getting the picture of the firemen turning up afterwards and hosing it down, you know. We get the news as it happens.  ", "I mean essentially we've got stringers in every corner of the world. It's a difference between getting the picture of the explosion as it happens and getting the picture of the firemen turning up afterwards and hosing it down, you know. We get the news as it happens.", "Even further, this ubiquity can provide perspectives of events that differ from \u201cofficial perspectives\u201d carefully crafted and provided to the media. A recent example is Saddam Hussein's execution where mobile phone images taken by guards and posted on the Internet after the initial story aired provided a very different perspective, one in which the proceedings had little dignity (Oliver, 2007). For ABC Vice President Bob Murphy, this example reveals \u201cthe potential of cell phone video as a powerful new source for news organizations\u201d (Bauder, 2007). Nevertheless, journalists remain very dependent upon \u201cofficial sources\u201d due to the nature of their news agenda. Still, new media can also help break stories, as BBC Editor Craig Oliver (2007) writes: When Sir Michael Jackson said that army accommodation was \u201cshaming\u201d, the Ten O'Clock News wanted to find out if that was true. A combination of appeals for pictures on our website and army message boards provided us with the evidence to put to the man in charge of accommodation, who admitted it wasn't good enough.

A combination of appeals for pictures on our website and army message boards provided us with the evidence to put to the man in charge of accommodation, who admitted it wasn't good enough.", "Some journalists who are more technically knowledgeable and keen to embrace new media when it enhances news output make use of personal blogs, Google's indexing and search function, a BlackBerry and an Internet connection in order to quickly access information previously stored to challenge the subject of a news item: I'm also not tethered to my desktop, my physical computer at work.

The Internet is a \u201cfantastic tool for research\u201d (Kevin Backhurst, BBC News24 Controller). Journalists can now \u201cscan the web world for ideas, for possibilities\u201d and the blogosphere plays an increasingly important role: \u201ca lot of the blogs that Canadian journalists would rely on are like an internal wire service for journalists\u201d (Tony Burman, CBC Editor-in-Chief). Blogs are accessed by journalists for a variety of reasons: background information, story ideas, alternative viewpoints, and occasionally as news sources. Most journalists limit their contact with the blogosphere to keyword searches on Technorati (a blog indexing service of 72.9 million blogs4) or BlogPulse 5 as a means of gauging general opinions on a topic or, more often, for background information, but overall journalists are progressively including this practice into their daily routines (EURO RSCG, 2005). Global Editor Peter Kent says, \u201cYou might look in on [blogs] just to see what the mood is, the public mood is on topic X or issue Y but I wouldn't ever use it as a primary source\u201d. Nevertheless, BBC Deputy Editor Daniel Pearl (2006) claims that Technorati was the tool through which the blogosphere had \u201can immediate impact on Newsnight's running order\u201d.", "E-mail alone has widened the range of accessible sources, depending on how one exploits new media. CTV Parliamentary Correspondent David Akin encourages journalists to harvest e-mail addresses from publicists, academics or government officials in order to move from trying to find the needle in the haystack to \u201cask[ing] the haystack to produce the needle\u201d. As these individuals are all hoping to curry favour with journalists, Akin feels his approach \u201cis a great example of how you can use technology to accelerate your newsgathering, improve your newsgathering, widen your sources\u2014because I want to find people I've never heard of before\u201d. However, some more senior journalists clearly expressed their dislike for blogs: I'm not a big fan of blogs in the sense that I think it's vanity journalism. \u201cOh look at me, I can express an opinion on something\u201d. And I'm too much of an old style journalist, you know I still put value on fairness and balance and everything else. And I don't particularly care generally what most ill-informed people out there who appoint themselves pundits think. Because basically it's drinking bath water.

For instance, BBC News24 Chief Diplomatic Correspondent Paul Adams confesses, \u201cyou know I haven't yet been tempted to e-mail a blogger. Perhaps that's rather narrow-minded of me\u201d. Adams views this possible addition to his daily routines as a personal choice, not pre-determined by any organisational constraints.", "Bloggers who produce alternative news6 are increasingly important within conflict reporting and \u201cnarrow-mindedness\u201d may only lead to the rejection of material that might offer personal insight into political turmoil and violent conflict. This could indicate credibility concerns harboured under professional ideologies. CBC Editor-in-Chief Tony Burman admits, \u201cThere's a real reluctance to accept what is read or circulated in blogs as being fact\u201d. Nonetheless, some journalists underscored the future value of blogs, in this case referring to the Iraq war: You'll have the mainstream media saying one thing and [Iraqi] blogs saying another. Blogs will inevitably become a legitimate source for broadcasters. They could become used just as a wire service\u2014the ones that tend to be reliable.

Their stated aim is to \u201credress some of the inequities in media attention by leveraging the power of citizens\u2019 media\u201d.7 Nevertheless, invoking credibility appears to operate as a scapegoat at times, yet may also be a reflection of the inexperience within journalism practice more generally of dealing with such an inflated \u201cinformation-producing strata\u201d. More insight into this issue is derived from a recent study of foreign journalists\u2019 use of blogs within China. China presents a special set of circumstances due to information control policies and it is thus comprehensible why these journalists might find extra value in blogs as informants, yet these respondents \u201ctended to reject the idea that one can judge the \u201creliability\u201d of blogs in general\u2014and instead emphasised the need to evaluate the usefulness of each blog individually depending on the author's track record and reputation\u201d (MacKinnon, 2007, p. 3), which could be indicative of the development of these sources within restricted settings.", "Credibility issues have not altogether prevented news organisations, and even news agencies, from incorporating content from the blogosphere into their coverage, particularly as a supplement within online coverage (Kline and Burstein, 2005; McNair, 2006; Project for Excellence in Journalism, 2007). Most significant are the moments when bloggers can aid journalistic norms of balance by providing a wider spectrum of accounts of news events and dismantling obstacles of access encountered by mainstream journalists\u2014although smaller, more mobile technology and smaller crews have also helped reduce obstacles (Livingston and Van Belle, 2005). New media that can assist in such situations is very valuable, as can be seen in the current situation in Zimbabwe where bloggers and information sent from mobile phones makes up some of the only news coverage mainstream media organisations can acquire.8 Despite this explosion of accessible sources, the long-standing critique that mass media over-rely on \u201cofficial sources\u201d still largely holds; yet new media enables journalists to lessen this dependency through the expansion of personal networks and means of communication."]}, {"title": "Accountability", "paragraphs": ["The ubiquity of new media enables the production of far more images and videos, much more intensive reproduction and publication in far more easily accessible locations than ever before.

Adnan Hajj, a Lebanese freelance photographer, allegedly digitally manipulated extra plumes of smoke on to an image of the aftermath of an Israeli bombing raid on Beirut. In this case (also known as \u201cReutergate\u201d) bloggers were instrumental in exposing the faked photo and garnering attention to the incident. Reuters CEO Tom Glocer acknowledges Charles Johnson of the Little Green Footballs blog10 as the foremost player in this instance; Johnson is also claimed to be the impetus behind \u201cRathergate\u201d\u2014another agenda-setting, citizen-based \u201creport\u201d exposing the alleged errors in Dan Rather's CBS report criticising President Bush's US National Guard service\u2014along with the three lawyers who author the blog Power Line. Of course Exposuregates are not necessarily neutral in intention, as some bloggers employed Reutergate as a means of undermining the fact that buildings had actually been bombed, which is essentially equivalent to the practices of established lobby groups that have always sought influence over the larger narrative of a conflict, even with the use of \u201cold media\u201d.", "During an interview on BBC's Newsnight (8 August 2006), Reuters Editor Paul Holmes responded to the claims that Hajj doctored images, commenting on the role of the blogosphere in these revelations: I welcome, and Reuters welcomes, the scrutiny we come under from bloggers. We will consider criticism from any source and we will take it seriously. I think it has to be said, as well, that because of the blogging community, many of the more egregious breaches of journalistic ethics have been exposed. It makes the media much more accountable and much more transparent.  ", "I welcome, and Reuters welcomes, the scrutiny we come under from bloggers.

As Holmes suggests, accountability\u2014either the semblance of it or its actualized form\u2014becomes all the more important under the microscope of the public. Public scrutiny targeting mainstream media adds increasing pressure to improve transparency over decision-making processes in order to maintain audience trust and loyalty, which is particularly important in light of the abundance of choices now available to news consumers.", "This heightened public accountability is also a result of new media (text, e-mail, blogs) that drastically increases \u201cthe volume and the precision of complaints\u201d (Vince Carlin, CBC Ombudsman). Much more consequential than an increase in volume is the means through which audiences become aware of the need to complain: I remember one case where the majority came from some southern states\u2014from Alabama and Georgia\u2014and there's no conceivable way that these people saw the broadcast they were protesting but it was through an e-mail campaign that I\u2014I mean the joke I used to tell was I was hearing from people complaining about CBC's coverage, people who probably had not heard of Canada let alone the CBC and certainly had not seen or heard the report that they were allegedly so offended by.

(Tony Burman, CBC Editor-in-Chief)", "Situations like this are now typically the result of blog-based campaigns. With the advent of TiVos,11 live streaming video, video on demand and online archived news reports, there are many more ways for the public to record news than the days of rushing to find an empty videotape to spontaneously capture a disagreeable report. Today it is generally very easy to record digital copies of television programmes and post segments on to YouTube, Google Video or embed them on a blog, usually via one of these websites. This is exactly what university student Stephen Taylor did on his blog when he crafted a video12 to criticise CBC's coverage of the Conservative Party's caucus and the resulting protest against Prime Minister Stephen Harper's stance toward the Middle East during the 2006 Lebanon\u2013Israel conflict. His video compared Christina Lawand's report for CBC with CTV's report of the same event, concluding that CBC showed bias towards Harper by taking his comments out of context. CBC's report included a protestor's demands for the end to \u201cburning children and killing [of] innocent people\u201d, followed by Lawand's statement that \u201cHarper clearly wasn't swayed\u201d, and then Harper's apparent \u201cresponse\u201d: \u201cI'm not concerned or preoccupied in any way with reaction within individual communities. I think that reaction is very predictable\u201d. CTV's report involved a longer clip of Harper's full response, revealing that it was in fact related to a question about increased support from the Jewish community and negative responses among some portions of the Arab community in Canada.", "Blog-based campaigns such as Taylor's are effective since the rising currency of video often equates to instant persuasion, thereby magnifying the volume of complaints. E-mail-based campaigns are similar but generally the result of individuals signing up for mailing lists of particular groups known to be critical of the media (e.g. CAMERA or FAIR). Regardless of the medium, the growing organisation and effectiveness of citizens to influence opinions is enabled by new media and amplifies notions of accountability for news organisations."]}, {"title": "News Values", "paragraphs": ["Broadcasting production research cited above highlighted importance, interest, entertainment and proximity as crucial news values, along with the ever-important value placed on images.

New media have enabled news organisations to focus more on \u201clives\u201d and instantaneous coverage as a means of portraying a perception of immediacy in the sense that the news organisation is there. The media environment also encourages the predominance of immediacy with an escalation in the volume of video available via UGC and news agencies,13 along with the growing sector of 24-hour news with Al Jazeera English and France 24 joining the ever-expanding global news market in late 2006. As well, journalists are regularly operating in converged newsrooms where the news website has become vital for any mainstream news organisation\u2014\u201cin order for us to thrive and to survive we've got to go where audiences go\u201d (Tony Burman, CBC Editor-in-Chief).

CBC Executive Producer Paul Hambleton echoes these comments, combining both elements of immediacy: \u201cwe're in a constant state of war to be first with something, to be live with something and then we're just filling time, trying to have interesting programming\u201d. Accuracy is also never far off in these discussions: \u201cspeed and accuracy are the two main concerns. And you know for the bulletins speed is not so important, accuracy is as important.

CBC Supervising Technician Daniel Morin's primary responsibility is to offer technical support to field crews.

While news production research has typically concentrated on the factors that constrain individual journalists, the agency they can exploit is revealed within the decisions they make amid routinised production processes. Developments both within and external to news organisations have created opportunities for journalists to secure greater agency. Hence, collective monitoring of news agency feeds disperses power over selection, the readily accessible blogosphere greatly expands potential sources and knowledge of a wider range of discourses, and journalist blogging increases engagement with audiences while amplifying and extending the production process. Obstacles to incorporation of these practices into daily routines are largely a result of credibility concerns, followed by antagonistic attitudes towards citizen-produced content, and occasionally a lack of technological knowledge. Traditional constraining factors were not highlighted except in relation to journalist blogging, which is ultimately an upper management decision.", "However, not all developments favour journalistic agency. Elevated documentation and scrutiny by the public, along with more effective flak-producing campaigns, renders news organisations more aware of their accountability to audiences, or at least more willing to address potentially problematic content via public forums such as \u201cnewsroom blogs\u201d. While this development does not explicitly constrain journalists, the transformation of organisational notions of immediacy has operated as an expanding control mechanism, significantly reducing time allocated to journalists for news gathering.

Thus, production of major political news items has not been transformed; dissenting views and radical critiques of both foreign and domestic policies remain rare among mainstream news accounts despite their popularity elsewhere. Still, increased cultural and discursive production outside of mainstream media via new media platforms multiplies occasions for rational debate and discussion and in this sense \u201ccounter-public spheres\u201d can develop and challenge the dominant public sphere (Downey and Fenton, 2003, p. 193). This counter-publicity is inevitably applying pressure to the traditional orbit of mass media institutions, publics and governmental establishments. The future of journalism is now dependent upon the direction of upper management and their perceptions of audience needs as these decisions continue to restrict the actions of individual journalists. Will decisions by journalists that embrace the dynamic nature of new media become standardised forms of journalistic practice, with organisational policy tending to encourage journalists to exploit the democratising potential inherent within new media? Will the public continue to produce alternative content within counter-public spheres that engages with the dominant public sphere?
