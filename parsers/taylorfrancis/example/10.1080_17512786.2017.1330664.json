In this empirical study, we examine the changes that have taken place in European newspaper reviews during the last 50 years (1960\u20132010). Our sample consists of 205 highbrow arts reviews found in Helsingin Sanomat (Finland), Le Monde (France), ABC/El Pa\u00eds (Spain), Dagens Nyheter (Sweden) and The Guardian (UK). We analyse our sample using the framework of Shrum and observe possible changes in descriptive, entertainment, instructive, analytical and evaluative schemes of the reviews. Unlike one might expect in light of previous scholarly findings on the popularizing content of cultural journalism, the changes in European highbrow arts reviews between 1960 and 2010 are not drastic. If anything, the evaluation becomes more analytical and subtle, emphasizing the institutional role of highbrow arts reviews and the print newspaper as a traditional, rather conservative media.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The act of reviewing cultural products provides an important structural framework for the symbolic production of culture and the arts (Shrum 1996; Van Rees and Vermunt 1996; Janssen 1997, 1999). Reviews, as highly institutionalized and specialized texts, are \u201caesthetic selections by socially legitimated experts\u201d (Janssen, Verboord, and Kuipers 2011, 140). Reviewers can be considered important \u201ctastemakers\u201d and gatekeepers that allow only part of all cultural production to enter into the media by publicly stating its artistic value (Smith Maguire and Matthews 2014). In particular, when emphasizing the reviewer\u2019s gatekeeper role, there are important power struggles embedded in the criticism of cultural products and artworks. In the process of evaluating such products, reviewers help to distinguish between the \u201cpure\u201d and \u201cprofane\u201d culture (Bourdieu 1993, 1994); thus, the reviewer can be seen as a powerful player in the field of art. Critics are themselves part of the game, as just as there is no official education or title bestowed to become a reviewer, there is no objective way of authenticating the veracity or validity of their opinions (Van Rees 1989).", "Highbrow arts such as opera, ballet, theatre and poetry have long been considered among the most prestigious signs of legitimate culture, and mastering or understanding them a sign of high levels of cultural capital in practically the entire Western world (Bourdieu 1984; Levine 1988; DiMaggio 2012). Newspaper reviews have been an essential part of these art forms almost from the beginning; reviewing can be seen as a way of connecting individual works of art with this wider field of cultural valuation, and of legitimizing and disseminating their symbolic valuations.", "Reviewers are, of course, just one element of a much larger chain of cultural mediators at different levels. For instance, Janssen and Verboord (2015, 441\u2013442) distinguish gatekeeping, co-creating (or editing), connecting/networking, selling/marketing, distributing, censoring/protecting/supporting and, finally, \u201cevaluating, classifying and meaning making\u201d from each other as different forms of mediating culture. According to this classification, reviewers do not only evaluate whether something is good or bad, or valuable or insignificant; they also have an essential role in creating and spreading hierarchies, exemplified well by the rise of jazz or cinema into the canon of high art (cf. Baumann 2007; or Janssen, Verboord, and Kuipers 2011; see also Fishelov 2010). In the same vein, the criteria for reviewing are highly differentiated according to the genre in question (for an example of pop music reviewing and its audience-oriented criteria and style, see Van Venrooij and Schmutz 2010). Newspaper reviewing renews and strengthens power dynamics just like any other kind of criticism. For instance, debut novels are allocated less space in newspapers than novels written by established writers, and books published by large publishing houses get more coverage than those published by smaller companies (Van Rees and Vermunt 1996; Janssen 1997).", "In recent decades, reviewing practices have undergone substantial changes in terms of both the formats and the mediums in which their texts are published. While the circulation numbers of traditional outlets for reviews such as quality newspapers are decreasing everywhere in the Global North (cf. Weibull and Nilsson 2010; Brink Lund, Raeymaeckers, and Trappel 2011), the internet is becoming a substantial competitor to and replacement for traditional print media (McChesney 2011). This change is reflected profoundly in reviewing. The era in which aesthetic-normative reviews were published mostly in print newspapers, catalogues or specialized magazines, and written by authoritative experts, is over. There is now an increasing number of online reviews, published not only in electronic versions of traditional media but also in different Web portals and personal blogs, bringing on the dimension of peer-produced review content or \u201ccrowd wisdom\u201d and introducing profound changes in the valuations of the aesthetic criteria used in reviewing (cf. Arora and Vermeylen 2013; Verboord 2014).", "These recent fragmentations of the traditional modes of criticism have led to many fears regarding the loss of traditional, authoritative and evaluation-based reviewing: \u201cThe critic-as-instructor, as objective judge and expert, has yielded to the critic who shares personal reactions and subjective enthusiasm. If anyone can be a critic, there is hardly any need for specialized and devoted professionals\u201d (McDonald 2007, 5). In recent discussions on cultural journalism, there have been many claims of an ongoing \u201ccrisis\u201d (for an elaborate discussion, see Jaakkola 2014, 2015a). Its advocates claim that less space is being allocated to serious cultural journalism and that there is a clear popularization of content. The central fears of the crisis argument have to do with reviews: supposedly reviews are becoming shorter and bear increasingly less traditional aesthetic judgement, offering a voice to everyone and thus turning more repetitive and conservative (Berger 1998; Elkins 2003; McDonald 2007; Carroll 2009). Existing research on cultural journalism provides unambiguous answers to these claims. While there is a clear popularization of content in quality newspapers (Janssen 1999; Janssen, Verboord, and Kuipers 2011), the findings concerning the reduction of space assigned to and shortening of reviews are contradictory (Jaakkola 2015b; Heikkil\u00e4, Lauronen, and Purhonen 2017).", "Newspaper reviewing has traditionally been considered to have a less legitimate aura than other types of reviewing or \u201cserious criticism\u201d. According to Bourdieu, art reviews published in newspapers constitute a specific field between arts criticism and journalism (Bourdieu 1993); the cultural sections of newspapers have been called \u201csoft journalism\u201d to separate them from \u201charder\u201d areas like politics or news (Kristensen and From 2012). In recent years, facing a crisis in circulation numbers, cultural sections have become increasingly interested in establishing links between the cultural product and the potentially interested consumer (cf. Verboord and Janssen 2015)\u2014which has surely had an effect on reviewing practices. Following this argument, the journalistic reviewer has been considered a mere \u201cconsumer reporter \u2009\u2026\u2009 who records his or her likes or dislikes so that readers can use them to predict what shows, or books, or films they will like or dislike\u201d (Carroll 2009, 8).", "In recent years, reviewing practices have raised the interest of several scholars as a way of exploring and tracking the legitimation of ideologies via the dissemination of specialist art and culture reviews (Janssen 1997; Baumann 2007; Johnston and Baumann 2007; Van Venrooij and Schmutz 2010). However, to our knowledge, reviews have not yet been researched in light of the debate on the alleged crisis of cultural journalism and using longitudinal data derived from several different cultural domains. To do this, we use longitudinal newspaper data to assess the kinds of shifts that newspapers\u2019 reviewing practices have undergone during the last 50 years. Through a qualitative content analysis of a sample of reviews from five European countries, we focus on the possible shifts in five common elements of reviews. In the following sections, we first discuss the context of newspaper reviewing and then analyse the changes that have taken place between 1960 and 2010, first by considering quantitative background information and then through the lens of our main sample of newspaper reviews gathered for the purposes of this study."]}, {"title": "Research Design", "paragraphs": ["Using newspaper data drawn from different years solves the common problem encountered in cultural sociology: the scarcity of suitable longitudinal data. Our full data-set derives from a larger cross-national, longitudinal research project on the relationship between cultural and social stratification in post-1960s Europe (cf. Purhonen, Heikkil\u00e4, and Karademir Hazir 2017). The following newspapers and countries were included in this study: Helsingin Sanomat (HS) from Finland, Dagens Nyheter (DN) from Sweden, The Guardian (GU) from the United Kingdom, Le Monde (LM) from France, and ABC/El Pa\u00eds (ABC/EP)1 from Spain. The chosen newspapers share similar political views (with the exception of ABC), they all have roughly comparable circulation numbers and they can be considered nationally important quality dailies (cf. Janssen, Kuipers, and Verboord 2008; Jaakkola 2015a; Verboord, Kuipers, and Janssen 2015; Heikkil\u00e4, Lauronen, and Purhonen 2017). Culture and arts sections were created in most major European newspapers around the middle of the twentieth century (Jaakkola 2015a), which makes 1960 an interesting starting point for the exploration: using 10-year intervals between 1960 and 2010, we collected altogether 11,775 articles on culture from the newspapers from six time-points (1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010). In order to eliminate seasonal variation in arts coverage, we used \u201cconstructed weeks\u201d (Riffe, Aust, and Lacy 1993; Janssen, Kuipers, and Verboord 2008): each full year was divided into thirds (January to April, May to August, September to December) for which one full seven-day week was randomly constructed, totalling three weeks per selected year. We avoided the problem of operationalization by including all articles published in the chosen cultural sections and thematic cultural supplements. The articles were coded using Atlas.ti and a code system of 49 variables. Standard inter-coder reliability tests were conducted (Krippendorff 2004), with satisfactory results (Purhonen, Heikkil\u00e4, and Karademir Hazir 2017). The coding process and some of the variables and their categories were designed according to the work of Janssen, Verboord, and Kuipers (2011) to allow for future comparisons.", "We pursued answers to our research questions from both quantitative and qualitative angles. For the purposes of this paper, and to provide a background quantitative analysis, we extracted all the reviews (N\u2009=\u20093770) from the full data-set (N\u2009=\u200911,775) and analysed these using three variables: the type of article, coded into (1) review/critique, (2) interview/profile, (3) commentary text, (4) report/feature, (5) news, (6) preview, (7) announcement/list, (8) artistic text/fiction and (9) other; the size of the article, coded into (1) multiple pages, (2) whole page, (3) half of the page, (4) quarter page, (5) smaller article and (6) very small article; and finally the cultural field of the review, originally coded into 21 categories and further recoded into the most commonly reviewed cultural domains: (1) novels, (2) all other literature, (3) pop music, (4) classical music, (5) film, (6) television, (7) theatre, (8) fine arts and (9) other (including everything else).", "In addition, we constituted a smaller subsample of the full data consisting of theatre, novel2 and classical music reviews from the years 1960, 1980 and 2010. For each of these years, we selected five reviews per cultural domain and per country, thus altogether 225 reviews. There was some lack of suitable reviews that meant our sample did not reach that number: ABC published no novel reviews in 1960, GU published no novel reviews in 1980, EP published only two theatre reviews in 2010, ABC published only one classical music review in 1960 and LM published only four classical music reviews in 1960 and three in 2010. Thus, the final sample consisted of 205 reviews. While recognizing that the three chosen cultural domains include a variety of subgenres and types of cultural production, and vary across time, we argue that they form a data-set homogeneous enough to be studied as an example of highbrow reviews published in European quality newspapers. Theatre, novel and classical music reviews were chosen for several reasons. First, we wanted to include only internationally common cultural domains with long-standing historical roots; second, we wanted only areas considered \u201chighbrow\u201d (see, for instance, Janssen, Verboord, and Kuipers 2011) in order to make our sample as homogeneous as possible in terms of style; third, we wanted to include differently distributed cultural domains: one based on performing or live arts (theatre), one functioning merely through different distributable and portable \u201crecordings\u201d or reproductions (novels) and one distributable in both ways (classical music). Whenever not written originally in English (as in the case of reviews in GU), the review excerpts used were translated by the authors into English.", "We addressed our subsample using qualitative content analysis. Adapting the model of Schreier (2012), we first decided on our research question, then selected our material, decided on a suitable coding frame, divided our material into units of coding (individual articles derived from different years and cultural fields), tested and modified the coding frame and finally close-read the subsample while making formative and finally summative checks on reliability. During the close reading, we also looked for suitable examples of each of our coding categories (see the next section) and made comparisons across different years and cultural fields. Lastly, we interpreted our results in light of the original research question.", "In the literature, the most classical and common tasks assigned to reviewers are undoubtedly describing, interpreting and evaluating (Van Rees and Vermunt 1996). Wishing to enlarge our scope of analysis and make it apt for analysing changes in highbrow reviews, our coding frame was inspired by Shrum\u2019s (1991, 352): he distinguishes five components of reviews that could also be seen as \u201cperformance objectives\u201d of the reviewer. Descriptive elements refer to basic information about the cultural product (performers, authors, setting, etc.). Analytical elements provide the interpretative context for understanding the cultural product at hand (metaphors, symbolic meanings in the work, etc.). Entertainment elements include humour, wit, displays of outrage and other verbal resources used by the reviewer. The instruction element refers to indirect or straightforward advice to the artist(s): mainly explicit tips on how to make the cultural product better. The evaluative element, the possible weakening of which we assumed might work as a proxy for the possible \u201ccrisis\u201d in reviewing, is in many ways the backbone of what reviews stand for, namely positive or negative judgements about the artwork and recommendations for the potential consumer. Thus, these categories formed the basis of our qualitative content analysis."]}, {"title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["Figure 1 shows the relative shares of different article types in our data drawn from European newspapers in different years. We can see that reviews are by far the most common type of article found in our full data. Figure 1 also demonstrates that the relative amount of reviews has grown notably between 1960 and 2010; in 2010, 4 out of 10 articles are reviews, and all other types of article are far behind that numerically. The relative share of reviews rose remarkably from 1960 to 1980, and after a slight decline in 1990 and 2000 reached a new record in 2010. At the same time, the share of pure news has declined greatly since 1980, from one-quarter of all items to around one in seven.

The relative amount of half-page reviews has increased since 1970 only to decline again after 1990. The increase in the share of quarter-page reviews has faced a similar trajectory, but the decline started in 2000 in this case.

We can see that the absolute amount of reviews grows notably overall (with some decrease between 2000 and 2010), which means there is some level of increase in almost all of the cultural domains. Pop music reviews grow spectacularly in both absolute and relative numbers (while classical music reviews decrease in relative but not in absolute numbers). The relative amounts of novels, film and fine arts reviews are roughly similar across years. The most dramatic decrease is in theatre reviews, which diminish from almost 20 per cent to only 7 per cent between 1960 and 2010; it is the only cultural domain that decreases in terms of both relative and absolute numbers.

While the relative and absolute numbers of reviews have grown, the growth is not distributed equally across cultural domains.

According to our reading, the descriptive element is undoubtedly the most common and lasting element of European newspaper reviews. Therefore, description can be seen as constituting the most basic element of any review. The format has remained largely intact but has undergone some changes, from detailed in-text presentations in 1960 to visually simple and appealing text boxes from 1980 onwards. Both formats, in any case, contain the same kind of description of the events: time, location, artists and, in the case of 2010, often the price of the cultural product, whether it is a live show or a cultural item for personal consumption.

In the 1960s, the entertainment elements are typically rather simple displays of outrage or erudition. This is not a play it is a massacre.

The general style of the reviews becomes looser and more freely formulated through time, and in 2010 many reviews clearly have entertainment elements: Something in the book obviously appeals to the reader since even a more prejudiced reader has the strength to read it all through. It works as an entertainment and one cannot but admire the author of this book, which is thick as a brick. There is hardly a dead page anywhere.

However, our analysis shows that instruction abounds. It is rather straightforward in 1960\u2014most reviews show it explicitly\u2014but since 1980, the instructive element has become more subtle in tone. From a contemporary point of view, the instructive element used in the reviews of the 1960s is rather pitiless, and often focuses on the artists personally: One is tempted to tell Sylvie Favre that her ability to play the lost boys found was worthier of her skills in Barrage contre le Pacifique, and to Suzanne Flon that her immense talent fits better the texts of Anouilh or Audiberti. (LM 1960) Her dialogue is a mixture of quasi-music-hall (a sort of poor man\u2019s Osborne) and idiomatic pointlessness.

It does become subtler, more conditional and without doubt much less sarcastic and more focused on the personal experience of the reviewer: By heavily cutting the text, this could be quite a decent twenty-minute presentation.

According to Shrum (1991, 352), it is a reflection of \u201cthe critics\u2019 own proposals for the constructions of aesthetic significance\u201d. The analytical side may contain elements from a wide range of contexts (e.g. historical, linguistic or political frames). In some specific national and historical cases the analytical element overpowers all other elements. A good example is Spanish newspaper EP in 1980, in which almost all analysed reviews of novels focus on the difficult political situation of the time. One could also add that a review often places its object within a specific genre\u2014or alternatively contrasts it with some well-known genres\u2014thus making it more familiar to the reader and its interpretation easier.", "Contrary to what could have been expected in light of the discussion on the crisis of cultural journalism, the analysed reviews have, in fact, become more reflective and analytic through the years. This development is especially noticeable between 1960 and 1980; after that there is less change. In longer reviews, there is typically always an analytic element disregarding the year and the context.

In the 1960s and 1980s, the reviews still pay a great deal of attention to the specific minutiae of the cultural products; key elements like artists are often mentioned by name, and distinct elements of the artwork are evaluated separately. The choir, led with delicacy, mastery and sensitivity by Jos\u00e9 Perera, was finely in tune and showed an excellent quality in tone and brilliance.

(GU 2010)", "Albeit not the main topic of this paper, it is noteworthy that the analysed elements of reviews from different cultural domains face the changes in somewhat distinct ways. We have already mentioned that contemporary reviews have a general tendency of evaluating totality rather than details. This materializes differently in different cultural domains. In the theatre reviews of the 1960s, most reviews mention the reactions of the audience, such as the applause or noisy discontent of the public. For instance, a theatre review published in ABC in 1960 notes: Salvador Ferrer Maura came to greet [the public] at the end of the representation together with director Suarez Radillo and the actors amongst the applause of the audience, who cheered at the end of the first half and who laughed in some situations and with certain comic lines of the play.", "Salvador Ferrer Maura came to greet [the public] at the end of the representation together with director Suarez Radillo and the actors amongst the applause of the audience, who cheered at the end of the first half and who laughed in some situations and with certain comic lines of the play.", "In 2010, attention is focused on the totality and on the experience of the spectator (or reviewer); the audience as an entity is rarely mentioned. In the novel reviews of the 1960s, much attention is paid to the plot, but in more contemporary times, the attention turns to the author, sometimes to the extent that the reviews focus more on them than the novels under consideration. For instance, one of the first sentences of the El Pa\u00eds review of Barbara Pym\u2019s novels Jane and Prudence and A Glass of Blessings (in Spanish Los hombres de Wilmet) starts by stating that \u201cBarbara Pym (1913\u20131980), a contemporary of Muriel Spark, Jean Rhys or Iris Murdoch, is one of the smartest writers contemporary English fiction has given us\u201d, and it is not until the fourth paragraph of the six in total that the reviewer starts to write about the novels in question. We interpret these shifts as part of a general turn towards human-interest themes in cultural journalism (Kristensen and From 2012), and as a possible relocation of attention from the artwork to its creator(s). Interestingly, the reviews of classical music differ from the other reviews analysed here in this respect. First, they have remained more similar over time than other reviews in terms of style and evaluation criteria. Second, they are often more technical and use specific musical terminology (allegro, vivace, etc.) which is taken as granted as common knowledge. Literary and theatre reviews make do without invoking such specialized knowledge. We could conclude that among the cultural domains under examination, reviews of classical music are openly elitist and best conserve the ideals of traditional, authority-based reviewing."]}, {"title": "Conclusion and Discussion", "paragraphs": ["If judged based on our quantitative inquiry, we have seen that newspaper reviews are a growing genre of cultural commentary, as both their numbers and relative size have increased during the period under study. Newspaper reviews have taken on new features during this period; their layout has changed and become much more attractive for the reader, which indeed characterizes the development of newspaper layouts in general (cf. Heikkil\u00e4, Lauronen, and Purhonen 2017). The cultural pages in general are increasingly more attractive for the consumer (cf. Janssen and Verboord 2015) and attuned to the growing competition for potential readers\u2019 interests. For instance, we showed that in contemporary newspapers, essential information about the cultural products (name, name of artist, price and so forth) is often presented in separate text boxes and not scattered in the evaluation or omitted totally as was the case 50 years earlier. To recap, we did not find any signs of a decline of cultural reviews in the studied leading newspapers in our five countries. If anything, the reviews have become more analytical and reflective, and the reviewers now show their expertise more clearly. The major changes, if any, occurred rather early in our period of study, between 1960 and 1980.", "Between 1960 and 2010, there was a clear move towards delivering a more personal tone that emphasized the experience of the critic. This reflects the findings of several other scholars on the relativization and subjectivization of contemporary journalism (Kristensen 2010; Hellman and Jaakkola 2012; Jaakkola et al. 2015); journalism in general is seen to have become increasingly focused on storytelling, rather than on adhering to traditional journalistic values like keeping a critical distance and avoiding personal opinions: \u201cThe personification and eventification of cultural journalism have brought it closer to liquid modern general journalism, with journalists producing content where emotional appeal, storytelling, debate and entertainment are emphasized\u201d (Jaakkola et al. 2015, 819). This tendency is clear in reviews, but it does not mean their intrinsic characteristics\u2014most importantly evaluation\u2014have suffered.", "In general, we have found that the changes in the reviews are not very systematic or remarkable, and that the reviews have in fact preserved many of their essential features intact up till 2010. Cultural evaluations have become more subtle and reflective, and when there is judgement, it is not presented in such harsh and straightforward terms as in 1960. The humour and wit used in the reviews has also become much more delicate and finessed. The style of writing and the format of contemporary reviews are less strict and more varied in style than 50 years ago. This is accompanied by, and perhaps is also a consequence of, the fact that the evaluations pay more attention to the totality of the work instead of (and in some cases, in addition to) its details and individual components. Table 2 summarizes some of our basic findings in these respects.

Our sample was derived from six well-respected European quality dailies. While embedded in different media system models (cf. Hallin and Mancini 2004), the newspapers were rather similar in style, and there were no noticeable differences between the reviews extracted from them. This is perhaps attributable to the newspaper institutions themselves; traditional quality newspapers in their printed format, like the ones we have studied here, can easily be considered a rather conservative, slowly changing structure, which does not necessarily reflect well the rapid changes that have taken place in the field of culture. We consciously concentrated only on highbrow reviews in order to make our sample as homogeneous as possible; extending the qualitative exploration to reviews of cultural domains considered emerging or popular, such as film and popular music, is a task for future research.", "We detected no trends indicating drastic changes, not that spoke to a \u201ccrisis\u201d, in the long-standing elements of newspaper reviews of traditional highbrow arts between 1960 and 2010. Nevertheless, several ongoing structural changes will probably bring changes in future newspaper arts reviewing. Declining newspaper readership, the extension of reviewing in the digital media, forms of publishing not dependent on gatekeepers, the proliferation of peer-produced criticism and the general de-hierarchization in terms of the reviewer\u2019s expertise are phenomena that have prompted important discussions in recent years (Brink Lund, Raeymaeckers, and Trappel 2011; Hanrahan 2013; Verboord 2014; Kristensen and From 2015) and that clearly deserve more attention. The changes in traditional quality newspapers in the latter half of the twentieth century, as we have studied in this paper, perhaps provide us with a glimpse of what is ahead."]}], "references": [{"title": "The End of the Art Connoisseur?
