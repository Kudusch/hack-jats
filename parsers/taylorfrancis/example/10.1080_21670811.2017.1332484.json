This study shows there are some similarities, but also major cross-national differences, between young people in how they trust, are exposed to and find different news sources usable for information about their society. Students from all these countries have higher trust in traditional news media than in social media. However, young people in Norway living in high-trust environments tend to be exposed to a wider variety of news sources than the UK and Israeli students. They also tend to be more skeptical about social media as a useful source of information. Furthermore, this study suggests that in a national context of conflict and low trust in media, such as Israel, distrust in traditional news media can explain foreign news exposure online. However, the effect of trust in national media is not significant in the Norwegian and the UK sample, which highlights the importance of discussing online news exposure in different national political and media environments.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Delli Carpini (2000) argued that the internet would democratize news because it makes a variety of news sources available to everyone. The traditional news brands such as public broadcasting, the main \u201cpaid-for\u201d newspapers and commercial broadcasting offer news both offline and online (Curran et al. 2013), which makes the traditional news sources more available. In most European countries traditional news brands are still the most visited news sites online (Newman et al. 2016) and Curran et al. (2013) claim that the leading conglomerates have extended their hegemony across technologies so that traditional news is also the dominant content online. When users select news sources for their mobile devices, traditional journalists\u2019 content dominates their information repertoire (Wolf and Schnauber 2015).", "On the other hand, alternative news sources to traditional national news media have also become more available. Visiting foreign news (news from other countries) can bring additioinal news and contribute to different perspectives or views on your own country, and it may therefore be an alternative news source to national news media. However, these are still \u201ctraditional\u201d news sources in the sense that they are produced by full-time, professional journalists. Recent research shows that newspapers and broadcasters from other countries are more often visited by audiences in other countries (Thurman 2014).1 There are also blogs and websites of people other than journalists working for traditional news media brands. Social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, have also become important sources for accessing news. Young people are particularly likely to obtain news online or via social media (Holt et al. 2013; Newman et al. 2016). While more individuals, in particular young people, are disconnecting from traditional news media offline in Europe (Blekesaune, Elvestad, and Aalberg 2012), there is a need for more knowledge about their exposure to news online.", "Whereas the consumption of news from traditional media or new media seems beneficial for the democratic support, the consumption of news from social media is detrimental (Ceron and Memoli 2016, 234 ). Further, how people evaluate and trust different news sources has become more relevant in discussions of news exposure (see, for instance, Van Aelst et al. 2017). Exposure to alternative news sources online has been related to distrust in traditional news media. Those who tend not to trust the mainstream media seek alternative news sources online (Fletcher and Park 2017; Tsfati 2010; Tsfati and Cappella 2003). In an Israeli study, Tsfati (2010, 38) found traditional news media (mainstream media) exposure is related to trust in media, and exposure to non-mainstream sites (not the national traditional news sources) is related to media skepticism. However, there are still differences across nations according to the news environments and the exposure to news media (Aalberg and Curran 2012; Hallin and Mancini 2004), and introducing new media technology may not necessarily cause the same news exposure pattern across countries.", "Cross-national studies show that trust in media also varies across different media systems and nations (Fletcher and Park 2017; M\u00fcller 2013; Tsfati and Ariely 2014). There are considerable differences between individuals\u2019 trust in traditional news sources in countries of liberal media systems, compared with media systems where the state intervenes to ensure plurality, as in the Northern European countries (EBU 2016; M\u00fcller 2013). The uncertainties created by prolonged conflict (in Israel) may also affect how young people trust their media system (Peri 2012). Young people living in countries with low levels of conflict, where mainstream media are highly trusted, may relate differently to alternative news sources online, from those in countries with different media and political environments.", "In this study, we consider how young adults in Western democracies, who have grown up with a great number of news media choices, both offline and online, trust these different news media sources and how it matters for how they find alternative news sources useful. We will argue it is of importance to do this in a cross-country perspective, and investigate how living in quite different national contexts may affect how these young people trust and relate to alternative news sources online. Our data derive from students living in Israel, the United Kingdom and Norway. The main research question is: Can trust in national traditional news media explain differences in how students from Israel, Norway and the United Kingdom relate to alternative news sources online?", "We use the terms \u201cnational traditional news media\u201d and \u201calternative news sources.\u201d We are, nonetheless, aware that this is a difficult line to draw as mainstream news material is often circulated, out of context, on alternative platforms. However, we are aware that the term has substantially consistent meanings to people who read, watch and listen to such outlets (Rauch 2015, 137). In this study, for clarity of analysis, we distinguish between traditional news sources and alternative news sources. Traditional news sources include mainstream news media such as national public broadcasting, commercial broadcasting and \u201cpaid-for\u201d newspapers, both offline and online. Alternative news sources refers to (1) alternative media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and blogs, and (2) foreign news (news produced in a different country), which is a traditional news source, but from a possible alternative perspective (framing).", "Where alternative news sources are used, they can function in different ways. First, they can replace exposure to the traditional national news brands as a consequence of lack of trust in these media. Second, the fact that the majority of people use more than one news media source (Papathanassopoulos et al. 2013) also implies that the alternative news sources can work as a supplement to the traditional news brands, providing more information or information from other points of view. The first type of user can be described as a \u201cskeptical news user,\u201d while the second type is more like the \u201cnews junkie\u201d described by Prior (2007). The share of these types of users of alternative news sources might also differ across countries."]}, {"title": "Research Questions", "paragraphs": ["RQ1: How does trust in traditional news media and social media differ between students from Israel, Norway and the United Kingdom?RQ2: How can levels of trust in traditional and social media among Israeli, Norwegian and British students explain how they find social media and blogs useful for knowing what is going on in society?RQ3: How can different levels of trust in traditional and social media among Israeli, Norwegian and British students explain their exposure to news from foreign traditional newspapers online?", "RQ1: How does trust in traditional news media and social media differ between students from Israel, Norway and the United Kingdom?", "RQ2: How can levels of trust in traditional and social media among Israeli, Norwegian and British students explain how they find social media and blogs useful for knowing what is going on in society?", "RQ3: How can different levels of trust in traditional and social media among Israeli, Norwegian and British students explain their exposure to news from foreign traditional newspapers online?"]}, {"title": "Trust and News Exposure", "paragraphs": ["News consumption is a cornerstone of civic life. The maintenance of democracy depends on an individual\u2019s willingness to participate, which has in turn been linked to trust, or at the very least, to the creation of conditions of trust, so that citizens have access to information that is sufficiently reliable for them to hold power to account (O\u2019Neill 2002). Trust is also closely connected to the willingness of citizens to learn about their political surroundings (Aarts, Fladmoe, and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck 2012). The news media are an important source of information about politics and current affairs, and therefore play an important role in fostering either trust or suspicion in governments. Arguably, trust in the \u201cmessenger\u201d must therefore play an important role in the way in which such messages are interpreted (O\u2019Neill 2002). Major research efforts have been devoted to exploring how different media and how the media frame politics have effects on their audiences\u2019 political trust (Cappella and Jamieson 1997; Hopmann, Shehata, and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck 2015) and knowledge about or engagements in politics (Aarts and Semetko 2003; Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970). Theories of media malaise or cognitive mobilization, and of a virtuous circle, express how media are, or might be, expected to influence audiences.", "The media malaise hypothesis stresses that media (especially television), because of their focus on conflicts, violence and other negative aspects of politics, result in political cynicism and apathy (Robinson 1976). According to this theory, citizens will increasingly withdraw from the public sphere and become apathetic and disconnected when media focus on scandals, personal issues, sensational events and intrigues (Cappella and Jamieson 1997). The theory of the virtuous circle (Norris 2000) emphasizes differentiation and how the types of media and types of audience matter for the media\u2019s potential for influence, trust in politics and political learning. Due to a \u201cvirtuous circle,\u201d attention to the news media gradually reinforces civic engagement, just as civic engagement strengthens attention to the news (Norris 2000).", "More recent studies show how social media exposure is also related to trust. In their study of 11 nations, Fletcher and Park (2017) found that low trust in traditional news media is significantly associated with preference for non-mainstream news sources (either social media, blogs or news outlets that do not have either a print or broadcast legacy). Those with very high trust in the traditional news media are significantly less likely to have preferences for non-mainstream news sources. Johnson and Kaye (2015) found that reliance on social network sites leads to higher confidence in systems of governance in the United States, after controlling for strength of party ties, political ideology, political interest, reliance on traditional media and demographic variables. However, these apparently positive differences could be associated with the \u201cfilter bubble effect\u201d of social media, which in turn leads to greater political polarization (Bakshy, Messing, and Adamic 2015; Sunstein 2007). In other words, what appears to be greater trust may be accounted for by the screening out of unwanted dissonance.", "Tsfati\u2019s (2010) study linked polarization with a lack of trust, finding that skepticism toward mainstream media is negatively correlated with internet mainstream news exposure, and exposure to non-mainstream sites is related to media skepticism. This tends to support the \u201cvirtual circle\u201d theory, but trust varies nationally in relation to both media institutions and forms of governance. For example, a later study of trust in media across 44 countries shows that state ownership of television is positively associated with media trust in democratic societies and negatively associated with trust in media in non-democratic societies (Tsfati and Ariely 2014). But even among democratic countries with public ownership of television, there are cross-country differences in citizens\u2019 trust in media and news exposure. For instance, in the democratic-corporatist media systems of Belgium, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, researchers find a positive relationship between using newspapers and public service broadcasting, and levels of political trust. In the United Kingdom and the United States, that relation holds only for BBC and NBC news, not for reading newspapers (Aarts, Fladmoe, and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck 2012).2"]}, {"title": "Trust and News Exposure in Israel, Norway and the United Kingdom", "paragraphs": ["In order to consider the differences between young people\u2019s news exposure in different systems it is important to understand in what ways the informational, national and political context differ (Hallin and Mancini 2004).", "Israel represents a hybrid case within Hallin and Mancini\u2019s (2004) typologies of media systems (Tenenboim-Weinblatt 2014). Although the Israeli media system is closest to the Liberal system, and has shifted in recent decades from party-press parallelism toward an increasing neoliberal orientation, it still bears marks from several systems (Peri 2012). There is a concentration of the media market (Davidson, in Tenenboim-Weinblatt 2014), but the newspaper circulation and news consumption is still very high in Israel, and the consumers are not only from the elite (Peri 2012). Israelis are described as \u201cnews junkies\u201d (Esser et al. 2012) because of their high levels of news consumption. The main news media usage among Israelis is online (27 percent) followed by 22 percent television news, 21 percent printed news, 19 percent radio, 7 percent smartphone and 4 percent social media (Maagar-Mochot Institute Research 2014). The uncertainties created by prolonged conflict have been argued to have increased the need for information, interpretation of events and forecast of future developments among the Israeli (Peri 2012).", "Like the Israelis, the Norwegians are heavy news consumers but the media systems differ. The media system of Norway has been categorized as a North European democratic-corporatist model (Hallin and Mancini 2004) or as a media welfare system (Syvertsen et al. 2014). Norwegians are high consumers of news media compared with other Western countries. They are offered an abundance of news throughout the day (Esser et al. 2012). In Norway, strong public service broadcasting and press subsidies that support newspapers from disparate local communities or ideologies are part of the welfare-state policy. Media choice proliferation gives public service broadcast outlets competition, but they are still the most popular channels among Norwegians (Vaage 2015). Additionally, there are more local newspapers today than 20 years ago (H\u00f8st 2014).3 The majority of the Norwegian newspapers are also available online. More newspapers are on Facebook/Twitter. Yet, while newspapers are still relevant to the majority of the Norwegians, there is evidence of a slight decrease in daily readership over the last 20 years (Vaage 2015). Internet access has increased quickly in Norway and websites from traditional news media are now important sources of news on all levels (Vaage 2015). In 2014, 96 percent of the Norwegian population between 9 and 79\u00a0years had internet access at home. Facebook is the main social media, and 64 percent of the Norwegian population used Facebook on an average day (Vaage 2015).4", "The United Kingdom is categorized in the Hallin and Mancini (2004) model of media systems as falling within the North Atlantic or liberal model. It is, however, by no means a \u201cpure\u201d example of the liberal model. Br\u00fcggermann et al. (2014) suggest four new models, and here the United Kingdom is placed in a model of Central Europe together with countries such as Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The United Kingdom has a dominant public service broadcaster in the BBC, which is by a long way the biggest news provider, and the whole broadcasting sector is regulated to ensure a degree of neutrality in political reporting, particularly at elections. The national newspaper sector is competitive, free market liberal but also politically polarized. Its local newspaper sector is probably the only section that conforms to the North Atlantic model in that it is privately owned but tends to monopoly (35 percent of local papers are monopolies in their area), however, it lacks the \u201cprofessionalizing\u201d patina of the US press and, in spite of its monopoly status, there is no assumption of political neutrality. The main platform for news in the United Kingdom is television, used by 75 percent of adults. Newspapers are used by 55 percent of those over 55 and 33 percent of those aged 16\u201324; 41 percent use the internet or a news app for news (60 percent among 16\u201334\u00a0year olds) (Ofcom 2014). Facebook is also the main social media in the United Kingdom. The Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2014 found that 61 percent of their sample had accessed a Facebook account in the previous week, 22 percent for news.5", "Studies show that people in different national contexts do not trust different media equally (EBU 2016; Newman et al. 2016). We also expect to find in our sample some differences according to trust in different news sources. Strabac and Aalberg (2009) find in their study that both in the United Kingdom and Norway, individuals trust television news more than newspapers. But this study also shows national differences. Individuals from the United Kingdom have less trust in newspapers than the Norwegians (Strabac and Aalberg 2009). A YouGov poll (Kellner 2012) found that trust in journalism in the United Kingdom is highly differentiated, with the BBC most trusted and journalists on the highly competitive red-top tabloids trusted by only 10 percent of those polled. Levels of trust across all media appear to have been affected by recurrent scandals that have engulfed the news media. The revelations of the Leveson Inquiry and the BBC\u2019s response to a major sex abuse scandal in 2012 were accompanied by a significant dip in levels of trust across all news media, as captured in the 2012 YouGov poll (Kellner 2012). The trust in media is low in Israel, and it varies across the different ethnic and religious groups (Herman et al. 2014)."]}, {"title": "Data and Method", "paragraphs": ["We use data from a cross-national survey (N = 944) and from in-depth interviews with 37 students in Israel, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Some simply accepted that the delivery systems for news are imperfect and seemed untroubled by the implications, but others made some effort to verify stories, usually by checking against the more trusted, traditional sources of news (mainly the BBC). The Norwegian students in this sample express high trust in their traditional media; like the UK students, they are inclined to use traditional sources as a means of verifying news picked up online.", "The Norwegian students are most exposed to newspapers (online in particular). They also have higher trust in their \u201cpaid-for\u201d newspapers than the Israeli students have, and much more trust than the UK sample have in their newspapers. The Norwegian students were the least likely to trust alternative sources like blogs as much as the traditional media or journalists from traditional media. This was confirmed in the interviews. Anders, a male Norwegian student (26\u00a0years), says the following about why a newspaper is more trustworthy than alternative news sources such as blogs:I do not know how to say this, but it\u2019s like, you are going with the flow, in a way, about what to watch and what to believe. A national newspaper is more trustworthy than a small blog on the internet \u2026 It\u2019s because they are reputable journalists, like for instance VG [national newspaper], they have uncovered big cases, and then your trust in that newspaper also increases.", "I do not know how to say this, but it\u2019s like, you are going with the flow, in a way, about what to watch and what to believe.

In our sample, the Norwegian students visit all the social media sources and the traditional news media online more often than the UK and Israeli students (except for YouTube which the Israeli students visited more often). The findings that the Norwegians visit alternative news sources more often does not necessarily imply that they find these sources useful for knowing what is going on in society. RQ2 asked whether there is a link between trust in traditional national media and how useful the students find social media and blogs for information about their society in the different national contexts. In Table 1, we show how national context, and trust in traditional and social media, can explain differences in how useful the students find social media and blogs.", "Table 1 shows that even though the Norwegians are visiting social media (except for YouTube) more often, they do not find these media very useful for knowing what is going on in their society. The UK and Israeli students are much more likely to find Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, blogs and Instagram useful for discovering information about their society. Among the Israeli students, Facebook was the media the majority found to be very useful, while both in the UK and Norwegian sample, traditional news sources were found to be more useful than all social media (see Appendix A, Table A3). On an individual level, students with higher trust in social media are more likely to find Facebook and Twitter very useful than those with lower trust. However, our findings do not imply that students who distrust their national traditional news media are more likely to find Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and blogs to be useful for information about their society. Only for Instagram do we find a significant link: students with lower trust in traditional news media are more likely to find Instagram useful for information about society. In addition to the usefulness of alternative media, we also control for how useful the students find the traditional media (newspapers print/online, radio and television news) (see Appendix A, Table A4). These analyses showed the opposite trend. The Norwegian students found these traditional news sources more useful than the UK and Israeli students, and individuals with higher trust in traditional news media not surprisingly find them more useful for knowing what is going on in society (not significant for the usefulness of radio news). This confirms the findings in Figure 1, which showed that the Norwegian distinguish more between news sources than the UK and the Israeli students. The interviews also confirm these findings. While talking to the Norwegian students, hardly any of them mentioned social media, blogs and websites to be of importance for information about their society.", "Israeli students showed less trust in their traditional news media than the Norwegians did. Unlike the interviews with the British and Norwegian students, the Israeli students were also more likely to say that they often read several sources and alternative sources as a way of arriving at a more balanced account of the main traditional media agenda in their country. Natalie, a female Israeli student (23\u00a0years), expressed this by saying \u201cA long time ago, you used to open the newspaper, and say, this is reality. But, today you believe less. You need more understanding, because it\u2019s difficult. And then you go to Twitter and to informal sites.\u201d This last female Israeli student highlights how living in a country with a high level of conflict might be a reason for expanding your understanding of the situation by visiting alternative news sources online.", "Foreign newspapers online may be both a source of more information and a source of other ways of framing the news. RQ3 asked whether different levels of trust in traditional and social media among Israeli, Norwegian and British students can explain their exposure to foreign traditional newspapers online. In Table 2, we show how trust in media is related to how often the students visit foreign newspapers online.", "Table 2 shows that 22.5 percent of the variation in \u201cvisiting foreign newspapers online\u201d can be explained by country, trust in traditional and social media, political interest, gender and age. Analysis of the total sample shows that male students, and students with high interest in both national and international politics, more often visit foreign newspapers online. We also find that those who have higher trust in social media visit foreign newspapers online more often than others do, while those with less trust in traditional media also visit foreign newspapers more often. The table shows some cross-national differences. The Norwegian students visit foreign newspapers online more frequently than the Israeli and the UK students.", "The use of international newspapers online is for the Norwegian students not (significantly) correlated with distrust in their traditional national news media. When students said they searched for foreign news sources online, the reason they gave in the interviews was primarily to get more information rather than information that is more trusted. Anders, a male Norwegian student (26\u00a0years), expresses it this way: \u201cI was visiting VG [national newspaper] online \u2026 but I didn\u2019t feel I got enough information there and therefore I went to Al Jazeera.\u201d", "The high interest in foreign news among the Norwegians can be explained by the high focus on international news in their domestic media. A recent study shows that \u201cNorway has not only the most internationalist news websites but also the most internationalist TV news of the nine nations, reflecting the country\u2019s strongly internationalist political culture\u201d (Curran et al. 2013, 889). While the search for foreign news among the Norwegian students is not correlated with distrust in their national news media, our findings shows that distrust in traditional media explains how often the Israeli students visit foreign newspapers. In our interviews with Israeli students, only three of them said they used international news media. They were concerned about how the international world (BBC and CNN) views Jewish people or were interested in how Arabic news channels framed the conflicts in Israel. A female Arab-Israeli student (22\u00a0years) said \u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone so I compare,\u201d and she used Arabic channels to know what was going on in Palestine and Israeli media to know what was happening in Israel."]}, {"title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["In this study, we find that sampled students in Israel, Norway and the United Kingdom have higher trust in traditional news media than in social media, which confirms how leading media conglomerates have extended their hegemony across technologies (Curran et al. 2013). Several studies (see, for instance, M\u00fcller 2013; Fletcher and Park 2017) use trust in media in general to measure how trust changes or affects news exposure. However, to study how individuals trust or relate to news in the new media environment is more complex. Our findings highlight the importance of measuring trust in a more specified way than just general trust in media. The students in our sample clearly distinguish between different news sources and brands when they evaluate news. Further, the ways in which they trust and relate to news are highly dependent on the national environments they live in.", "In the total sample, those with low levels of trust in traditional news media do not tend to use alternative news sources such as social media more often, neither do they find social media and blogs more useful for what is going on in society. However, they are somewhat more likely to access foreign news sites online. There are also some cross-national differences. The Norwegian students most clearly show high trust in traditional news media brands (especially the public service broadcaster) alongside high exposure to a variety of news sources via a variety of platforms. They have the highest levels of trust in traditional news brands of the three countries and visit traditional and alternative news sources online (except for YouTube) more often than the students in the other countries. The Norwegian students also found traditional news media (television/radio news and online/print newspapers) more useful for knowing \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in society\u201d than the students from Israel and the United Kingdom; while the UK and Israeli students found social media and blogs to be more useful than Norwegian students.", "The skepticism of the UK students is transformed into exposure online. They are the most suspicious of the three groups, with low levels of trust in all traditional news media brands. They have the lowest levels of exposure to news on all platforms, which is consistent with findings in the Reuters Digital News Report 2014, which also found relatively low levels of interest in news (Newman and Levy 2014). Israeli students are also lacking in trust but their lack of trust has not been translated into withdrawal from news consumption. They are more likely than the UK students to visit other sites online and are more likely to consume both traditional and alternative news sources online. While the Norwegian students have highest trust in the traditional news media brands, they are more skeptical of social media. They are even more skeptical than the UK and Israeli students. This shows that for the Norwegian students there is a greater gap between trustworthy news (in particular from the public broadcaster) and the news from the social media, than is the case in the other two countries.", "The quantitative results are amplified by the qualitative research, which helps to explain these differences. In Norway, the students were concerned with getting the right information, or enough information, through the news media. For instance, several of the Norwegian students mentioned that they go to foreign newspapers online to get more detailed and updated information about international conflicts. They are mildly critical and aware of news framing and bias but they have sufficient trust in their own national media to use it as a starting point for their explorations elsewhere. This study indicates that the Norwegian students who visit alternative news sources online are more like the \u201cnews junkies\u201d Prior (2007) describes than skeptical news searchers.", "The qualitative research in the United Kingdom indicated that the UK students are afraid that they are not getting trustworthy news. Many use social media as the starting point for news consumption, rather than traditional news, although they are still inclined to use traditional news sources as a means of verifying what they read, but there appears to be clear evidence that a significant proportion are withdrawing from involvement with news altogether. Levels of mistrust of both social media and traditional media mean that some of these students are not engaging with news in any significant way at all. They might be watching sports reports on apps but have no significant knowledge of national or world events.", "In Israel, lack of trust makes for anxious news consumers. Living in a particularly uncertain part of the world, withdrawal from the news media is not really an option, but they have lower trust in their traditional news than the Norwegians do. This may also explain how trust is a more important explanatory variable for use of alternative news sources online, which was also found in Tsfati\u2019s (2010) study among Israelis. The Israeli students\u2019 use of foreign newspapers online is more likely to be a consequence of a lack of trust in the way national Israeli news media cover ongoing conflicts in their own and other countries. On the one hand, Norwegian students, who live in a country with a more homogenous population and a low political conflict level, seek foreign newspapers for more information (news junkies); on the other hand, Israeli students, who live in a country with a more diverse population (ethnically and religiously) and high level of political conflict, are searching foreign news media for alternative perspectives, voices, framings, etc. (critical news consumers). They are acutely aware not only of the need to know what is going on, but also of the need to check whether what they are consuming is trustworthy.", "This is a student sample, which is not representative of all social groups. However, it does provide insights into how young adults in higher education think about, trust and use news media in a new media environment in three national contexts. In contemporary democracies, traditional news media constitute the most important source of information about politics and current affairs (Gunther and Mughan 2000). We collected the data in 2014 and, in a fast-changing media and political environment, we cannot assume that attitudes or behavior will remain the same. Distrust of the news media could be a growing problem for the future. We need more research into those who avoid news. Are they avoiding the news because they lack trust in the news or because they do not care about what is going on? Or is it that there is too much information and they lack the tools to find their way through it? Or, following Cappella and Jamieson (1997), are they put off news because of its negativity? This study has also highlighted the need for more studies that investigate trust in media in a more sophisticated way than just measuring trust in media in general. Lastly, our study points to the lack of research concerning the connection between national contexts and increasing distrust in traditional mainstream media."]}, {"title": "Disclosure Statement", "paragraphs": ["No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors."]}], "references": [{"title": "The Divided Electorate: Media Use and Political Involvement", "year": "2003", "journal": "The Journal of Politics", "volume": "65", "authors": [{"name": "Aarts Kees", "first_name": "Aarts", "last_name": "Kees"}, {"name": "Semetko Holli A.", "first_name": "Semetko", "last_name": "A."}]}, {"title": "Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook", "year": "2015", "journal": "Science", "volume": "348", "authors": [{"name": "Bakshy Eytan", "first_name": "Bakshy", "last_name": "Eytan"}, {"name": "Messing Solomon", "first_name": "Messing", "last_name": "Solomon"}, {"name": "Adamic Lada A.", "first_name": "Adamic", "last_name": "A."}]}, {"title": "Tuning Out the World of News and current affairs.
