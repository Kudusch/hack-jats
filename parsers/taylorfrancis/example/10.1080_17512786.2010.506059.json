This article examines six narratives of trauma subjects, conducted throughout Australia, drawing on the manuscript Speaking Secrets. Framing the subjects' recounts as a form of advocacy journalism, particular focus is given to the role of empathy in eliciting and retelling trauma stories, and its effects on the journalist. The article argues for greater discussion of empathy as an ethical tool of journalism within the industry and academy, and a remedy to public distrust, rather than a notion regarded by most as antithetical. ", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In this article, I discuss research gathered through narrative interviews conducted throughout Australia, that deal with sexual and sexuality secrets, all traumatic to varying degrees, and their re-telling in the public sphere through the genre of creative non-fiction or long-form literary journalism. Through reflective journalistic practice, it is my purpose to highlight the imperative of empathy as an ethical necessity when dealing with subjects recounting traumatic incidents in their lives by pointing to the emotional act of this retelling; the reasons that may drive a person to retell in the first place; and the professional practitioner's response to these acts.", "The article is structured as follows. After referring to Janet Malcolm, one of the more critical and universally read authors of the literature dealing with the subject\u2013writer relationship and journalism ethics, I explain the research project that resulted in the manuscript Speaking Secrets. At this point, I argue that empathy must be embraced and taught at tertiary level to journalism students, not as a notion to shy away from but one that will eventually enhance ethical professional practice, particularly pertinent in the long-form creative non-fiction genre. And as such, could act as a remedy to the collective culture of distrust that journalistic practice and practitioners engender in the public domain.", "Next I reproduce several of the voices from the manuscript Speaking Secrets, to highlight the interviewer\u2013subject relationship at the point of gathering data. This section highlights the tension between storyteller and story gatherer, and decisions both make, at the crucial point of traumatic recount. I also discuss here the effect interviewing subjects who have undergone trauma may have on the interviewer, often creating a secondary trauma and how reflective response to this can be effectively transposed to the page.", "In the penultimate section, I consider my response when one of the subjects refused to allow his chapter to go ahead to publication, and his reasons. This investigates the thought processes I went through in dealing with his decision and as such, delineating the basis of a reflective practice model I now relay to students, to begin to discuss how empathy can feed into a more ethical professional practice.", "And the final section of the paper discusses how effectively subjects who have undergone traumatic experiences in their lives and attempt to recount them publicly, often see the recounting as a form of advocacy and in doing so, create meaning from their suffering on a community level."]}, {"title": "The Journalist and the Critic", "paragraphs": ["There is an ephemeral intimacy established between storyteller and story gatherer. An immediate relationship is formed when a journalist and subject come face-to-face; even before, in negotiating agreement, time and place for an interview. It smacks of opportunistic potential at the time of interviewing but ends when the journalist walks out the door with what they came for in the first place: the story. The question that must be asked is: what is left behind? Is it an empowered subject feeling they have achieved what they set out to achieve? Or is it a damaged person\u2014re-traumatised by remembering\u2014and wondering whether they have said too much and how it will be used and retold and represented by this person who seemed so genuine and \u201cfriendly\u201d at the time? Trusting that the integrity of what has passed between them will be maintained but really, having no idea until it is seen or heard, after reproduction.", "Janet Malcolm's controversial book The Journalist and the Murderer (1990) highlighted the notions of false friendship. Malcolm takes one case history in her seminal text published in 1990, and does more to damage the already quite challenged name, reputation and profession of journalism and journalists than any text has done in the past. The infamous opening lines of the book position her immediately: \u201cEvery journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible\u201d (Malcolm, 1990, p. 3).", "Malcolm's story \u201cReflections: The Journalist and the Murderer\u201d, in the form of extended essay, first appeared as a two-part article in The New Yorker. 1 But as an example of extreme writer/subject duplicity, Malcolm's dissection of literary journalist Joe McGinniss\u2019 journalism practice surrounding his coverage of the Jeffery MacDonald multiple murder case, is damning.", "Philip Weiss wrote at the time: \u201cIf Janet Malcolm had blown up an ink factory, forcing the presses to shut down for a week, she couldn't have sparked greater outrage in the media kingdom\u201d (1990, p. 24).", "If Malcolm is guilty of one thing, it is hyperbole in those first few lines of her book. Perhaps it was intentional because it has certainly kept her in the forefront of mainstream journalism analysis and education, frequently cited in discussions surrounding journalistic ethics and practice, for the past 20 years. But most striking is what she eventually concludes\u2014this is a relationship, and both parties have something to do with its dynamic and reality. Malcolm places heaviest responsibility on the journalist but also concedes that subjects play a part in the dance, albeit a mostly compromised part: \u201cThe subject's side of the equation is not without its moral problems, either\u201d (Malcolm, 1990, p. 143). This role is often overlooked by critics of journalism practice. She likens subjects to young Aztecs, living in luxury before their selection for ultimate sacrifice is fulfilled: journalistic subjects know all too well what awaits them when the days of wine and roses\u2014the days of the interviews\u2014are over. And still they say yes when a journalist calls, and still they are astonished when they see the flash of the knife. (Malcolm, 1990, p. 145)  ", "journalistic subjects know all too well what awaits them when the days of wine and roses\u2014the days of the interviews\u2014are over. And still they say yes when a journalist calls, and still they are astonished when they see the flash of the knife. (Malcolm, 1990, p. 145)", "I suggest that only the media-savvy journalistic subject with misgivings about possible misrepresentation in the media, may behave accordingly. And even then, that knowledge is not a shield from damage through misrepresentation of both self and meaning. Subjects of the journalistic interview are part of what is widely believed to be a clearly defined relationship. But in reality, it is not. The journalist, when sitting in front of his or her computer, ultimately has the final say, despite what has transpired throughout the interview process. Jon Krakauer warns: \u201cI explain that if they decide to talk to me it will have to be for their own reasons, and they had better be good reasons, because what I write could turn their lives inside out\u201d (in Boynton, 2005, p. 168).", "Matthew Ricketson differentiates between the roles of the journalist as interviewer or reporter, and the journalist as writer. He claims the writer's first duty is always to his or her reader. And that even ethical journalists will experience some sort of conflict, on some level, with interactions with their interviewees. He writes: Even the most ethical journalists struggle with the shift in role from being a sympathetic, charming listener in an interview to a dispassionate, tough-minded writer, sitting at the keyboard. You can feel as if you are \u201cseducing\u201d then \u201cbetraying\u201d the subject, particularly in profiles where you get closer to the person. It is probably more important to be aware of this shift in attitude than to actually change it, because part of the dilemma is inherent in the job. (Ricketson, 2004, p. 116)  ", "Even the most ethical journalists struggle with the shift in role from being a sympathetic, charming listener in an interview to a dispassionate, tough-minded writer, sitting at the keyboard.

It is probably more important to be aware of this shift in attitude than to actually change it, because part of the dilemma is inherent in the job. (Ricketson, 2004, p. 116)", "Although both Malcolm and Krakauer argue that subjects have a certain agency in their choice to become involved as interviewees, journalists must make continuous ethical judgements about the capacity of their subjects, particularly subjects talking about deeply personal, traumatic, and/or sensitive topics, to continue with the interview. Silence is a ubiquitous derivative of trauma. And if the subjects of trauma finally decide to speak publicly, the interview process itself can be a traumatising experience. The mere fact the interviewee agrees to the interview is insufficient consent. Journalists must continuously question themselves and monitor the cues of the interview. And then, the handling of information by the journalist, particularly in long-form narrative, is integral to that experience. As Ricketson points out, there is a subtle shift in allegiance from the subject to the reader, once the journalist has completed the interview. This does not necessarily constitute a betrayal of the subject, but definitely could. I suggest at this point, it is an ethical imperative that the journalist maintains the utmost integrity of the intended meaning of what the subject said throughout the interview process. Likewise, that the written representation of the intended meaning is an integral ethical component of not just the final text but of a reflective practice model."]}, {"title": "Speaking Secrets", "paragraphs": ["The manuscript Speaking Secrets delves into 10 people's lives, asking questions about their most haunting and secret sexual traumas and memories, and how and when they finally spoke about them. And as such, is an evocative example of the tension between a writer and her subject, and the writer's representation of the interaction in the final text.", "The manuscript research sets out to establish an overt, visible relationship with each of the subjects and to hand that on to the reader in order to create an evocative and believable space for their voices to be heard and their stories to be told. Each story has been accompanied by rigorous research and fact checking, to allow a freer momentum for their voices. But indeed, there is a perception of false friendship about this process. It does not matter that the interviewee has agreed to talk about deeply personal and sometimes traumatic memories; the question is still, what right the interviewer has to be there in the first place?", "In the majority of interviews conducted for Speaking Secrets, at some stage it was necessary to ask the subject if they wanted to halt the interview because of how distressed they became through the re-telling of their story. The stories were necessary for the research and somehow, the more upset or re-traumatised the subject became, the more evocative the story telling became\u2014very possibly a \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d stance, as Malcolm points out. But as Catharine Stimpson writes: \u201cIt offers little consolation to writers of some integrity \u2026 such writers do what they must, but some blood will fleck the keyboards of even the wisest among them\u201d (1990, p. 902).", "The subjects include: Uniting Church leader Dorothy McRae-McMahon, of her public coming out at the 1999 Church forum; former international casting agent Liz Mullinar, following her near-death illness and discovery of childhood sexual abuse at the age of five, memories she had expunged for decades; David Cunningham, the NSW Greens\u2019 Party convenor and physically disabled, and his need and desire for some sort of fulfilling sex life; Arabella Joseph,2 a young lawyer, brutally sexually and psychologically abused by a family member from the age of 11 to 15; Russel Sykes, son of black activist Dr Roberta Sykes, on his discovery at the age of 30 that he was the product of a gang rape of his then 18-year-old mother\u2014it was a race crime and she was left for dead; Jenny Mendick and her desire to claim a space for women who have had mastectomy but choose not to have prosthesis\u2014her virtual gagging from the breast cancer community because of her stance; Rachael Wallbank, a sexually reassigned lawyer who took on the Australian Attorney-General against the Commonwealth\u2014and won the right for sexually reassigned people to marry; academic Jim Malcolm, who married at 20 even though he had been having sex with men for years\u2014he regarded himself as bisexual, finally leaving his wife and three children, more than a decade later; Lyn Austin, the first Stolen Generation survivor to receive financial compensation for the systematic physical, sexual and emotional abuse she sustained, once removed from her family as a 10-year-old; and finally, war crime victim Jan Ruff O-Herne, brutally raped by hundreds of Japanese military in one of the notorious Virgin Brothels, throughout the last few months of World War II in Indonesia.", "Each interviewee has been constrained, some for decades. So, how did they finally manage to speak up, and then why did they agree to speak to me? Is it the impetus to confess that Foucault wrote about? Truth, lodged in our most secret nature, demands only to surface; that if it fails to do so, this is because a constraint holds it in place, the violence of a power weighs it down, and it can only finally be articulated at the price of a kind of liberation.

(Foucault, 1976, p. 60)", "What Foucault has identified is a human need to confess, even when societal norms may discourage it. Perhaps this tendency to confess answers the age-old question of why people talk to journalists and divulge, sometimes, their deepest, darkest thoughts, moments and memories for public consumption.", "All interviewees were silenced or unable to tell their secret stories for various and varied reasons. But finally, each of them sought out the media to disclose their secrets. Their reasons are as diverse as they are personal. Catherine Kohler Riessman writes: some experiences are extremely difficult to speak about. Political conditions constrain particular events from being narrated. The ordinary response to atrocities is to banish them from awareness. Survivors of political torture, war and sexual crimes silence themselves and are silenced because it is too difficult to tell and to listen.

During this contact, the method and nature of the research was explained. Namely that they would be interviewed and photographed for inclusion in a manuscript with the possibility of publication.

Various theorists argue about the appropriateness of this\u2014indeed some proffer that it is preferable just to be silent and wait for a sign from the subject. However, this paper argues that it is incumbent on the interviewer to monitor the verbal and non-verbal cues of the subject and\u2014where a subject is distressed\u2014to remind them that they have a choice in the process of being interviewed. None of the subjects in Speaking Secrets elected to terminate the interview, despite probing questioning.", "Raymond Schroth writes: \u201cthat is the journalist's moral tension: one person's pain is another's stimulation, his living. Suffering sells. Yet the journalist, insofar as he or she is a human being, must strive to alleviate suffering\u201d (1995, p. 45). Schroth is arguing for the integrity of the story as told to be reproduced, not a version that makes for better reading. He is really calling for the highest integrity of the reporter.", "This paper argues that the mere fact the interviewee agrees to the interview is insufficient consent to an interview and published reproduction. Journalists must continuously question themselves and monitor the cues of the interview\u2014the beginnings of an ethical and empathetic model. They must adjust their \u201cmoral compass\u201d (Kovach et al., 2001, p. 181) continuously and reassess the ethical ramifications of continuing with the interview if there is clear distress. And then later, when sitting down to write, convey to the reader their interpretation of the interview process without embellishment. The only real licence here for the writer is their own reflective response to the experience, without assumption about their subject. Embedding the subject's words within their own response to the interaction is the reflective component of the process. Misrepresentation of meaning at this point is as duplicitous as fabricating or embellishing.", "Juxtaposed against this is the notion that if a victim or survivor has elected to speak to a journalist, respect must be given to how the subject tells the story. The journalist must not be deterred by a highly emotional subject. Psychiatrist Frank Ochberg3 suggests the journalist should come prepared, with tissues, like a \u201ctherapist\u201d. He explains: When survivors cry during interviews, they are not necessarily reluctant to continue. They may have difficulty communicating, but they often want to tell their stories. Interrupting them may be experienced as patronising and denying an opportunity to testify. (Cote and Simpson, 2006, p. 108)  ", "When survivors cry during interviews, they are not necessarily reluctant to continue. They may have difficulty communicating, but they often want to tell their stories. Interrupting them may be experienced as patronising and denying an opportunity to testify. (Cote and Simpson, 2006, p. 108)", "Ochberg asserts that asking the survivor or victim if they wish to terminate the interview, or terminating it, may itself constitute a re-victimisation of the subject. My research does not support this position. Instead it argues that any re-victimisation or re-traumatising will present itself in the recalling of memories in answering a journalist's questions, not a suggestion to have a break or halt the process. Indeed, asking if the subject wished to halt the process appeared to empower them, giving them a choice in the process at this emotional point.", "There were several moments throughout the manuscript research, whilst actively engaged in the middle of the interview process, where what I was hearing was so overwhelming that I would have liked to have halted the process. Much of what I heard was almost too hard to hear. But I argue that enduring the subject's clear distress and pain, in an intimate interview situation, leads to a deeper understanding and potentially more evocative writing. When the story gatherer's emotions are real and honest, that often implicitly translates to the page.", "When practising long-form narrative story gathering, there is no need for the dominant journalism practice discourse of performative detachment. A genuinely empathetic listener who takes cues from a subject recounting trauma, and who responds appropriately to both tears, protracted silences and body language, is creating the time and space for the subject to recount information in their own time and in their own way.", "Empathy, and its place within journalism practice and education, is discussed rarely in Australia, except perhaps more recently in the context of reporting on trauma and disaster.4 Creating an alternate discourse advocating less detachment and more overt compassion and empathy, particularly with subjects of trauma, does not have to be antithetical to professional practice. I believe the crucial role of journalism education in helping young journalists develop an appropriate \u201cmoral compass\u201d at this point should be a mandatory unit of tertiary learning. Working more explicitly with concepts of empathy and compassion may help position the journalist and allow him or her to make those voluntary ethical decisions about their subjects in a less detached fashion. Elizabeth Fakazis claims that the critical and the practical value of the notion of empathy has been seriously underestimated in journalism (2003, p. 57). She defines empathy as a \u201cdeep understanding of a subject's emotional and psychological perspective\u201d and argues that it has concrete pay offs for enhancing journalistic practice because it \u201ccan help journalists deepen their understanding, allowing them to not only observe what their subjects do but also why they do it\u201d (Fakazis, 2003, p. 46).", "Particularly in the long-form non-fiction genre, I argue that empathy is an effective and valid tool. Advocating a genuine empathetic listening technique that is an acceptable component of professional practice, instead of the current practice of detachment and impersonal engagement, or even the obverse of this\u2014the \u201cfalse friend\u201d\u2014can only improve experiences for subjects, particular of trauma. It makes for better and more thorough, less detached and more honest journalism, and is particularly pertinent in dealing with stories of people who have suffered injustice meted out through violence, trauma, prejudice or disaster.", "McKnight and O'Donnell write about \u201cinformation available in a liberal democratic society\u201d (2008, p. 23). Without public trust, stories needed to inform and create new discourse may never be revealed. In order to create a smoother flow of information to the public, the image of journalism practice and its integral function in society must be improved. I believe modelling this form of reflective journalism will enhance poor public perception of journalists and journalism as a practice. I argue discussing and teaching models of empathetic technique will build a greater trust and respect for the profession, and hence become a remedy for the cultural distrust in the public domain.", "In the next section, I attempt to outline, through a reflective discussion of my own responses and examples of embedding that response into the text, just one entry point into a debate surrounding empathy."]}, {"title": "Their Voices", "paragraphs": ["When I first contacted psychologist Russel Sykes, he immediately agreed to an interview and invited me to his home to conduct it. The day before the interview was scheduled, a less certain Sykes contacted me and said he simply was not comfortable with a stranger in his home.

During interview, Sykes appeared to dissociate several times whenever the topic of his mother's rape, and his very existence, came up. Sykes was asked many times\u2014more than any other subject in the manuscript\u2014if he wanted to halt the process. He declined every time and just seemed to want to talk, in his own way and at his own pace. Talking to him is difficult. No, talking to him is not difficult at all. Talking to him on this subject is.

Traumatic memory or recall, as painful as it is for the subject, is a haunting incident to witness, and then write about. Immediately, the writer has the story often visually re-enacted, but I suggest embedding the story within the effect it also created in the writer is a technique to once again challenge audiences. But as mentioned earlier, how ethical can it be? Without it, I could not have written about the moment when this elderly and dignified woman stroked the air, remembering her mother stroking her hair.

However, he did agree to the interview\u2014but at the time, not necessarily to publication. Perhaps arrogantly, I proceeded on the basis that he would ultimately be persuaded.", "His chapter in Speaking Secrets was perhaps one of the most powerful in the manuscript because of his prior relationship with the media. Malcolm is a man who was exploited on the ABC's Four Corners in the early 1990s; then agreed to come on to a national and live television chat show where he was ambushed and his character virtually destroyed by the host. Yet he still agreed to be interviewed for Speaking Secrets, with a potential for publication.", "However, having read his chapter, Malcolm did not give his permission7 for it to be published. I tried to persuade him; I cajoled him; I almost begged him but then I heard myself and realised, his refusing permission for publication is exactly what the research was about\u2014integrity and trust and ethics and empathy, as an intrinsic part of journalism practice. I stopped trying to convince him and just listened to him.", "He explained that reading my chapter on him truly taught him something about his prior choices to expose himself in the media, and he decided it had to stop. He had to educate the world in other, less public ways.", "Effectively, Malcolm managed to take back some of his power which the media had taken from him. It was all about choice and control, and he demonstrates that while the story is of the utmost importance to a journalist, the person is more important. There seemed a certain synchronicity in his refusal to allow me to publish and on so many levels, he became the embodiment of this research."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Twenty years after Foucault wrote about the imperative to confess, already mentioned, Doug Birkhead appropriated this theory and inverted it, directly at the feet of journalists. He claims that journalism: \u201creflects an impulse to bring events into a forum so that they may be publicly accounted for. The press traditionally has sought to make itself\u2014and us\u2014bear responsibility of being witnesses rather than merely onlookers\u201d (Sims and Kramer, 1995, p. 13).", "Birkhead places journalists and the practice of journalism as public confessor\u2014a position of immense responsibility, in the name of the public's right to know. Interestingly, as a symbolic Fourth Estate, that is exactly the forum that each of the subjects in Speaking Secrets initially sought out to tell their untellable stories. This eagerness to tell reflects a collective impetus for righting wrongs and creating a space for social and political recognition. Many of them were intent on informing the public about mainly unspoken or taboo topics\u2014this seemed to be the common imperative. The subjects in Speaking Secrets all individually took on an almost advocacy role in agreeing to the interviews and the themes they were attempting to portray. Walter Lippmann likens the press to the beam of a searchlight, \u201cbringing one episode and then another out of darkness into vision\u201d (Cote and Simpson, 2006, p. 100). As Cote and Simpson write: Better reporting about trauma can help readers and viewers gain empathy for the suffering of victims and enrich everyone's awareness of the powerful role that trauma plays in people's collective lives \u2026 if the ultimate benefit is greater awareness of how others suffer from trauma, the publics\u2019 renewed capacity to offer collective care and support will be the greatest public benefit. (2006, p. 8)  ", "Better reporting about trauma can help readers and viewers gain empathy for the suffering of victims and enrich everyone's awareness of the powerful role that trauma plays in people's collective lives \u2026 if the ultimate benefit is greater awareness of how others suffer from trauma, the publics\u2019 renewed capacity to offer collective care and support will be the greatest public benefit. (2006, p. 8)", "And this is what the subjects in Speaking Secrets collectively aspired to\u2014educating the public and bringing taboo subjects \u201cout of the darkness\u201d.", "But possibly the most important issue in the current research is that each story is the subject's own story, finally told to a story gatherer, in their own way. This does not mean that rigorous research and cross-referencing is not necessary in order for the journalist to do their job properly. It just means that the subject needs to feel some control, or trust, at this stage. Genuine empathy is of paramount importance in engendering trust and upholding this relationship, not just during the interviewing process, but afterwards, at the computer screen, when that relationship is transposed on to the page, filtered through the writer's own lifetime experiences. This is particularly pertinent in long-form narrative where there has been a far greater time investment than daily journalism. Cote and Simpson write: Trauma may leave a person feeling violated, angry, powerless. Many trauma victims feel their suffering had had some purpose if their story is told at the right time and in the right way. It can be a catharsis that releases some pain and gives their lives new dignity. (2006, p. 121)  ", "Trauma may leave a person feeling violated, angry, powerless. Many trauma victims feel their suffering had had some purpose if their story is told at the right time and in the right way. It can be a catharsis that releases some pain and gives their lives new dignity. (2006, p. 121)", "They argue that this is a process that could help victims become survivors within their communities, and bring some different meaning to their suffering. Flowing on from this, I argue that it is universally understood that culturally, the public harbours a ubiquitous distrust in journalism as a practice. This position clearly impedes the flow of information of this nature, particularly about taboo societal subjects. Discourse needs to be developed around difficult and challenging issues. Modelling and teaching empathetic technique and reflective journalism practice, particularly in the long-form narrative, is the remedy."]}], "references": [{"title": "\u201cThe Winter of Journalism&#039;s Content\u201d", "year": "2008", "journal": "The Australian Higher Education Supplement", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "McKnight David", "first_name": "McKnight", "last_name": "David"}, {"name": "O'donnell Penny", "first_name": "O'donnell", "last_name": "Penny"}]}, {"title": "\u201c\u2026but It&#039;s Really Burning: tragedy and the journalistic conscience\u201d", "year": "1995", "journal": "Columbia Journalism Review", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Schroth Raymond", "first_name": "Schroth", "last_name": "Raymond"}]}, {"title": "\u201cThe Haunted House\u201d", "year": "1990", "journal": "The Nation (New York)", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Stimpson Catharine", "first_name": "Stimpson", "last_name": "Catharine"}]}]}
