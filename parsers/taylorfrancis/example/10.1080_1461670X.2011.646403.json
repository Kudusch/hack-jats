The data analysed include: (1) magazine articles published in The IPA Review during 1989\u20132009; (2) op-eds published by IPA senior staff in Australian newspapers during 1989\u20132009; and (3) editorials and opinion columns that praised IPA associate Ian Plimer and his climate \u201csceptic\u201d book during April to June 2009 in the lead-up to the first Australian parliamentary debates on introducing an ETS. ", "body": [{"sec_title": "Introduction", "sec_content": ["Despite the nearly universal (97 per cent) scientific consensus on the tenets of anthropogenic climate change as outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Anderegg et al., 2010), there is still an ongoing \u201cscientific\u201d debate on the reality, causes and consequences of climate change in certain sections of the Australian news media (Manne, 2011; McKewon, 2009; Taylor, 2010). This is a problem because most people get their information about science from the news media (Nelkin, 1987), especially climate science (Wilson, 1995); this includes most journalists who do not specialise in science or environment reporting (Wilson, 2000). News coverage of science shapes public understanding and action, which in turn influences the translation of science into policy (Boykoff and Rajan, 2007). Lack of public support for policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions reduces the likelihood that governments will take effective action in time to avoid the worst-case scenarios of climate change.", "As the scientific consensus on climate change strengthened over the past three decades, the news media in a number of countries created the false impression of an increasing \u201cscientific debate\u201d; these countries include the United States (Antilla, 2005, 2010; Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004), the United Kingdom (Boykoff and Mansfield, 2008; Carvalho, 2007) and Australia (Manne, 2011; McKewon, 2009; Taylor, 2010). Taylor's frame analysis found that the Australian news media began to diverge from the scientific consensus on climate change during the 1990s, when news framing of climate change shifted: from a clear and committed-to-action early understanding \u2026 to confusion and \u201cjustified\u201d inaction as the 1990s progressed. This occurred despite the science information about causes, effects and risks changing remarkably little and has continued beyond the study period to contemporary discourse. (2010, p. 5)  ", "from a clear and committed-to-action early understanding \u2026 to confusion and \u201cjustified\u201d inaction as the 1990s progressed. This occurred despite the science information about causes, effects and risks changing remarkably little and has continued beyond the study period to contemporary discourse. (2010, p. 5)", "Like previous studies conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom, Taylor found that some sections of the news media give equal or greater attention and status to contrarians who are unconvinced by the evidence of anthropogenic climate change and remain opposed to mitigation strategies. Manne's (2011) analysis of news stories and opinion columns published in The Australian newspaper during January 2004 to April 2011 found that, of the total 880 items in the sample, only 180 accepted the scientific consensus and the need for action on climate change while 700 rejected them. Having set the objects of analysis as the news media and news media texts, most previous studies on climate change in the news media tend to provide \u201cinternalist\u201d reasons for the divergence between the news media's reporting of climate science and the scientific consensus; these reasons include the objectivity norm in journalism (Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004; Taylor, 2010), journalists\u2019 poor understanding of the science (Antilla, 2005; Boykoff and Mansfield, 2008) and self-censorship (Antilla, 2010). However, while Boykoff and Mansfield (2008) conducted interviews with journalists to investigate their hypothesis, generally these studies have not clearly demonstrated that their conclusions are unambiguously supported by the data. Other studies have drawn more reliable conclusions regarding \u201cinternalist\u201d reasons for the over-representation of climate contrarian views in some sections of the news media\u2014for example, some studies have compared newspapers across the political spectrum and determined that the news organisations with conservative ideological cultures tended to favour climate \u201csceptics\u201d (Carvalho, 2007; Manne, 2011; McKewon, 2009; Painter, 2011)\u2014as the observations were drawn from the data."]}, {"sec_title": "Neoliberal Think Tanks as News Sources", "sec_content": ["This study expands the scope of analysis to examine \u201cexternalist\u201d factors such as the influence exerted by news sources who seek to discredit authoritative scientific research. For the purposes of this paper, the news media are defined as the traditional publishing platforms\u2014such as newspapers, radio and television\u2014through which daily reports and commentary on current events are distributed to the general public. Access to the news media offers news sources a profound form of power, because the media provide the public with information that is outside their direct experience or everyday lives, thereby shaping their sense of reality about the world (Lippmann, 1922). McCombs and Shaw (1972) further propose that the news media set the agenda of topics for public thought and discussion, and play a key role in the social construction of reality (see also McCombs, 2005).", "Gans describes news sources as \u201cholders of power\u201d who should be studied to determine which groups they represent and what \u201cagendas [and] interests they pursue in seeking access to the news\u201d (1979, p. 360). He further argues that \u201cemphasising the role of sources is the best way \u2026 to connect the study of journalism to the larger society\u201d (in Schlesinger, 1990, p. 61). This view is supported by Schlesinger (1990; Schlesinger and Howard, 2004), who sees news sources as \u201ccompetitive definers\u201d engaged in a contest to define the truth; this is part of the broader process whereby societal and political conflicts play out in the news media. He warns against \u201cexcessive media centrism\u201d in journalism research (Schlesinger, 1990, p. 61) and suggests that news sources be studied as \u201cpolitical entrepreneurs\u201d who aim to \u201cinfluence the political agenda and shape the interpretation of current issues\u201d (1990, p. 79). Similarly, Ericson et al. (1989) posit that the reality constructed through the news media originates with news sources, who access the media with the aim of achieving definitional advantage.", "Neoliberal think tanks are among the most well-funded and influential news sources in the United States and Australia. Allen defines them as \u201cprofessional social movement organisations funded by economic elites to influence public opinion and the agendas of political elites\u201d (1992, p. 90). The primary role of neoliberal think tanks is to access the media in order to influence public opinion and advocate policies that are consistent with the interests of their organisational sponsors (Allen, 1992). Stone distinguishes the \u201cold guard institutes\u201d that characterised the early academic, non-political tradition of think tanks from the \u201cnew partisans\u201d such as neoliberal think tanks which are \u201cincreasingly entrepreneurial and likely to be more \u2026 directly policy focused and partisan in their research and analysis\u201d (1996, p. 18). Nevertheless, these new partisans present themselves as non-partisan policy-research institutes (Cahill, 2004; Lieberman, 2000; Smith and Marden, 2008; Soley, 1993) and operate as non-profit organisations, with all donations from sponsors tax-deductable.", "In keeping with the interests of the economic elites who fund them, neoliberal think tanks promote core values of the political Right\u2014free market capitalism, anti-socialism, privatisation, small government and deregulation (Cahill, 2004; Mirowski and Plehwe, 2009); this includes opposition to industry oversight and environmental regulations such as an ETS (Dunlap and McCright, 2010; Jacques et al., 2008; Oreskes and Conway, 2010). Their rhetorical approach to mounting opposition to environmental regulations is to oppose the science on which the proposed regulations are based.", "As neoliberal think tanks are not academic or scientific organisations, their strategy for neutralising the consensus in a number of scientific fields has often involved recruiting contrarian scientists (often not experts in the relevant field) who are willing to undermine the scientific consensus in interviews with the news media; this creates the impression of a genuine \u201cscientific debate\u201d while legitimising attacks on authoritative scientific research (Jacques et al., 2008; Oreskes and Conway, 2010). This strategy was pioneered by the tobacco industry in the United States during the 1950s (Hertsgaard, 2006; Mirowski, 2011; Muggli et al., 2004; Union of Concerned Scientists, 2007) and has been used to undermine public confidence in scientific research that linked tobacco smoke with lung cancer, coal smoke with acid rain, and chlorofluorocarbons with stratospheric ozone depletion (Oreskes and Conway, 2010; Rampton and Stauber, 2001).", "Since the 1990s, neoliberal think tanks funded by the fossil fuel, mining and energy industries in the United States have formed alliances with contrarian \u201cexperts\u201d\u2014many of whom have no expertise in the field of climate science\u2014who are prepared to challenge the scientific consensus on climate change (Beder, 2002; Dunlap and McCright, 2010; Gelbspan, 2004; Jacques et al., 2008; Leggett, 2001; Oreskes and Conway, 2010); the same strategy has been used by Australian think tanks to reconstruct the scientific consensus on climate change as a \u201cscientific debate\u201d in the Australian news media (Hamilton, 2010, 2007; McKewon, 2009; Pearse, 2007). This is consistent with the interests of donors such as American oil billionaires Charles and David Koch (Mayer, 2010), Australian mining magnate Hugh Morgan (Smith and Marden, 2008) and the world's biggest oil company, ExxonMobil. During the years 1998 and 2004, it is estimated ExxonMobil alone donated $16 million to think tanks that ran media campaigns to \u201cmanufacture doubt\u201d on the science of climate change (Adam, 2009; Mooney, 2005; Union of Concerned Scientists, 2007).", "Neoliberal think tanks also often construct media events by publishing books that promote \u201cenvironmental scepticism\u201d in the lead-up to major environmental policy debates (Jacques et al., 2008). These constructed media events maximise news coverage at the most politically strategic time to influence public opinion and the policy agenda. Of 141 English-language \u201cenvironmentally sceptical\u201d books published between 1972 and 2005, Jacques and colleagues found that 92 per cent were published by neoliberal think tanks or their associates; meanwhile, they found that 90 per cent of neoliberal think tanks that engage in environmental issues espouse \u201cscepticism\u201d. The majority of these books were published in the months before two major environmental conferences: the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and the third session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC which adopted the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 (Jacques et al., 2008)."]}, {"sec_title": "The Institute of Public Affairs", "sec_content": ["The IPA is an Australian neoliberal think tank and high-profile news source that rejects the evidence of anthropogenic climate change and opposes mitigation strategies such as an ETS. It has long-standing connections to the right-wing Liberal Party in Australia, having been founded by senior members of the Liberal Party in 1943. Yet the IPA describes itself as an \u201cindependent \u2026 public policy think tank\u201d that promotes \u201cthe free market of ideas, the free flow of capital [and] a limited and efficient government\u201d (IPA, 2010a).", "Like its counterparts in the United States, the IPA also opposes environmental regulations. In 2005, the IPA established the Australian Environment Foundation, which is marketed as a grassroots environmental movement (The Canberra Times, 2005), but actually fights to prevent or reverse environmental regulations (Fyfe, 2005). In 2008, following the federal election of the (Labor) Rudd government, which promised to introduce an ETS, the Australian Environment Foundation spawned a second-tier IPA front group, the Australian Climate Science Coalition (ACSC), which consists mainly of an advisory board of contrarian scientists. Through media interviews, newspaper op-eds, magazine articles and books, the ACSC rejects the evidence of anthropogenic climate change and opposes mitigation policies (ACSC, 2009).", "Along with these two front groups, the IPA is the most active and vocal Australian neoliberal think tank that uses its access to the news media to dispute anthropogenic global warming and oppose policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Hamilton, 2007; Pearse, 2007, 2009). Its major corporate donors include companies in the fossil fuel, mining and energy industries (Fist, 2000; Hannan and Carney, 2005) including coal-fired electricity generators in Victoria and New South Wales (Pearse, 2009). The IPA also receives substantial donations from oil companies (Frew, 2007) and the tobacco and forestry industries (Vincent, 2004).", "The IPA's source\u2013media strategy includes publishing op-eds in newspapers, being quoted as a news source and providing \u201cexpert\u201d commentary on radio and television (IPA, 2010b). The IPA frequently invites newspaper editors, journalists and broadcasters to its lectures, policy seminars (Cahill, 2004) and the launches of books written by IPA staff and associates (McKewon, 2009). Its quarterly magazine, The IPA Review, is distributed to members and sold through local newsagents (Cahill, 2004).", "Right-wing newspaper columnists in Australia often look to the IPA and its front groups to articulate ideologically consistent rhetoric and policy positions on a range of environmental issues, including climate change (Pearse, 2007). Cahill (2004) also found that think tanks like the IPA form the \u201cbackbone of the neoliberal movement\u201d and function as authors of policy ideas and rhetoric that chain out through (what Hajer, 1993 called) \u201cdiscourse coalitions\u201d, which include right-wing editors and journalists: \u201cThe [neoliberal] movement has furnished journalists\u2014particularly fellow travelling sympathisers\u2014with the movement's rhetorical arsenal: an arsenal which has been vigorously used to demonise [its opponents]\u201d (Cahill, 2004, p. 270)."]}, {"sec_title": "Background\u2014Plimer Book", "sec_content": ["In the lead-up to the first Australian parliamentary debates on introducing an ETS in 2009, Ian Plimer\u2014mining geologist, mining company director (Ivanhoe Australia, 2009), IPA associate scholar (IPA, 2009a), ACSC scientific advisor (ACSC, 2009), and climate change contrarian\u2014published a book that argues there is no link between human activities and climate change. Plimer boasted that his book, Heaven and Earth: global warming\u2014the missing science (2009a), would \u201cknock out every single argument we hear about climate change\u201d (Jenkin, 2009). The book was not peer-reviewed before publication and was widely discredited by scientists on the basis that it reflects a poor understanding of the climate system, includes unattributed material (including graphs), presents misleading or incorrect data, fails to present evidence to support conclusions, misrepresents scientific studies cited as support for his claims, and relies on historical arguments that have long been refuted and abandoned in peer-reviewed scientific journals (Ashley, 2009; Brook, 2009; Enting, 2009; Glikson, 2009; Karoly, 2009; Lambeck, 2009; Morton, 2009; Sandiford, 2009; Veron, 2009; Walter, 2009; Woodroffe et al., 2009). The only scientists who gave the book positive reviews were those who, like Plimer, were associated with the IPA and its front group, the ACSC (Carter et al., 2009; Kinninmonth, 2009).", "Plimer's book and the coverage it generated did not just challenge the scientific consensus on climate change; it presented an elaborate alternative reality composed of conspiracy-fuelled fantasy themes developed by the IPA; for example, \u201cGlobal warming has become the secular religion of today\u201d (2009a, pp. 462\u20133) and \u201cThe environmental religion embraces anti-human totalitarianism\u201d (2009a, p. 466). Although neoliberal think tanks and right-wing politicians and pundits in the United States have been using the same fantasy themes since at least the 1990s (see for example Coffman, 1994; Nelson, 1996), the earliest references I have found of the above fantasy themes are in The IPA Review in 1989. The publication of these and several other IPA fantasy themes in Heaven and Earth enabled them to chain out to a wider audience during three months of high-profile media coverage in Australia (April to June 2009). During this time, the IPA was never mentioned, despite the book's strong links to the organisation. Apart from Plimer's direct link as an associate scholar, the IPA's Executive Director, John Roskam, sits on the editorial board of Connor Court Publishing (Connor Court Publishing, 2009a; IPA, 2009b) which published Heaven and Earth (Connor Court Publishing, 2009b). The IPA also launched the book and promoted it on the IPA's website (IPA, 2009c), while the publisher sent advance copies to right-wing newspaper journalists and editors: [T]here was no PR company involved and no sophisticated marketing strategy. Instead, Anthony Cappello, the publisher \u2026 hit the phone and rang his mates. The fact that he is well connected with the conservative media was his greatest asset, along with the fact that his contacts are desperate for a counter view on global warming \u2026 Cappello says the success [of the book] is due to all the pre-publicity he's been doing since September, although again this seems to have been targeted mostly at the right.

The initial stage of this analysis involves the identification of the anti-climate science fantasy themes developed by the IPA and published in its quarterly magazine, The IPA Review. The analysis then traces the chaining out of these fantasy themes from the IPA into Australian newspapers via intertextual chains routed through two channels.", "In the first (direct) channel, IPA senior staff publish op-eds that contain the fantasy themes in Australian newspapers. The op-ed represents a prestigious form of newspaper coverage for a news source: it is authored by the news source and so the source's version of reality is presented undiluted and uncrowded by the reporting of news events, editorial framing or competing news sources quoted in the same news story. At the same time, the newspaper's publication of the op-ed bestows a special status on the news source\u2014what Fairclough (1995) might call \u201cauthorised knower\u201d.", "In the second (indirect) channel, right-wing newspaper editors and columnists use the IPA's fantasy themes as the rhetorical basis for editorial leaders and opinion pieces praising Plimer and his book. The writers in this category, often senior-ranking journalists, are also presented as \u201cauthorised knowers\u201d whose opinion-based commentary about reported news and current events is valued by the newspaper and its readers. The communicative tone employed by editors and opinion columnists is characterised by authoritative language, declarative sentences and categorical statements. This authoritative communication style also serves to project the audience as \u201creceptive, waiting to be told, wanting to know\u201d (Fairclough, 1995, p. 4).", "This analysis uses a hybrid of Discourse Analysis (DA) and Fantasy Theme Analysis (FTA) to examine samples from the three datasets described above. Drawing on the theory of Fairclough (1995) on media discourse, the DA aims to answer three sets of questions: How is the world (events, relationships) represented? What identities are set up for those involved in the story (journalists, audiences, \u201cthird parties\u201d referred to or interviewed)? What relationships are set up between those involved (e.g. journalist\u2013audience, expert\u2013audience relationships)? (Fairclough, 1995, p. 5). In an effort to answer these questions, the more detailed framework of the analysis is provided by FTA, taken from Symbolic Convergence Theory. FTA is a valuable tool for identifying, categorising and evaluating the components of the rhetorical vision revealed in the texts; however, the broader societal implications of the IPA's rhetorical vision and its chaining out into the news media are better understood when the fantasy themes are further analysed within the context of Fairclough's questions as outlined above.", "Bormann's Symbolic Convergence Theory (SCT) is a general communication theory that offers an explanation for the process by which groups develop and share a symbolic reality. The process firstly involves the creation and sharing of stories, or fantasy themes, within small groups; the fantasy themes then chain out from person to person, and from group to group\u2014often through the mass media\u2014to create a shared social reality or rhetorical vision. The basic concept of SCT is the fantasy theme, which is a structured dramatic account of a real-world experience (Bormann, 1972). Fantasy theme is further defined as \u201cthe creative and imaginative shared interpretation of events that fulfills a group psychological or rhetorical need\u201d (Bormann, 1985, p. 130). Fantasy themes are stories driven by dramatis personae\u2014stock characters such as protagonists (i.e. heroes, victims) and antagonists (i.e. villains)\u2014and are often grounded in the personality traits, moral codes and motives of the characters: When someone dramatizes an event he or she must select certain people to be the focus of the story and present them in a favorable light while selecting others to be portrayed in a more negative fashion \u2026 Interpreting events in terms of human action allows us to assign responsibility, to praise or blame, to arouse and propitiate guilt, to hate, and to love. (Bormann, 1992, pp. 368\u20139)  ", "When someone dramatizes an event he or she must select certain people to be the focus of the story and present them in a favorable light while selecting others to be portrayed in a more negative fashion \u2026 Interpreting events in terms of human action allows us to assign responsibility, to praise or blame, to arouse and propitiate guilt, to hate, and to love. (Bormann, 1992, pp. 368\u20139)", "FTA involves the identification of the fantasy themes that construct a group's rhetorical vision. It also involves the identification of associated basic concepts such as characters, plot lines, settings, sanctioning agents and symbolic cues. Sanctioning agents, which justify the drama, might be a higher power or a sacred principle such as Truth or \u201ceven a concept such as \u2018weapons of mass destruction\u2019\u201d (Duffy, 2003, p. 294). A symbolic cue might be an inside joke, code word, phrase, slogan or the name of a persona or organisation that drives a fantasy theme; the function of the cue is to trigger an emotional response such as anger, hatred, love, affection and even laughter or humour from other group members. Symbolic cues provide one indication that symbolic convergence has taken place (Bormann, 1985)."]}, {"sec_title": "Methods", "sec_content": ["Three datasets were used in the qualitative analysis: (1) magazine articles published in The IPA Review during 1989\u20132009; (2) op-eds published by IPA senior staff in Australian newspapers during 1989\u20132009; and (3) editorials and opinion columns that gave favourable coverage to Ian Plimer and his book during April to June 2009 in the lead-up to the first Australian parliamentary debates on introducing an ETS.", "The first sample of magazine articles was generated by searching the IPA website's archives of The IPA Review including the years 1989\u20132009, as 1989 is the year in which The\u00a0IPAReview published its first article on the enhanced Greenhouse Effect (Roskam, 2010).

The sanctioning agent here is Truth.

According to the plot line of the fantasy theme \u201cClimate Scientists as Rent-seeking Frauds\u201d, climate scientists are not engaged in a pursuit of the truth through science\u2014on the contrary, climate scientists routinely fabricate data, misrepresent the results of their studies and exaggerate the threat of climate change to extract lucrative research grants from the government.", "The fantasy theme \u201cClimate Science as Religion\u201d posits that climate science is not science\u2014it is a manifestation of the new \u201cenvironmental religion\u201d. This fantasy theme enables evidence-based scientific conclusions to be dismissed as an arbitrary set of beliefs or dogma. The plot line of the fantasy theme \u201cClimate Science as Left-wing Political Conspiracy\u201d sees the environmental religion's leftist allies (Labor and Green political parties, and even the United Nations) using climate change as a \u201cscare tactic\u201d to consolidate their political power, increase taxes to redistribute wealth, and impose a New World Order that will compromise national sovereignty and restrict personal freedoms. These two fantasy themes serve to delegitimate the most vocal social groups who accept the scientific consensus and support action on climate change: the environmental movement and the political Left. They are portrayed not as people rationally responding to a real environmental threat identified by the science: they are variously cast as irrational religious fundamentalists following a doomsday cult or as left-wing conspirators cynically using a fabricated or exaggerated threat to pursue political goals.", "The following two sections offer examples from each dataset to illustrate three of the most prominent fantasy themes in greater detail: \u201cClimate Science as Religion\u201d; \u201cEnvironmentalism as Religion\u201d and \u201cClimate Scientists as Rent-seeking Frauds\u201d.", "The excerpts below, taken from all three datasets, are examples of how the \u201cClimate Science as Religion\u201d and \u201cEnvironmentalism as Religion\u201d fantasy themes are articulated. Although these are two discrete fantasy themes, it was often not possible to separate them because time and again the rhetoric conflates climate scientists with the environmental movement and climate science with religion. It is also not unusual for other fantasy themes to be supplemented within the same excerpt, since all the fantasy themes combined serve to construct the overarching rhetorical vision. Symbolic cues for these two religious fantasy themes include words such as \u201creligion\u201d, \u201cfaith\u201d, \u201chymn\u201d, \u201cdoom\u201d and \u201cfundamentalism\u201d.", "The IPA's hostility towards the increasing scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change is documented in The IPA Review from the year 1989, in the year leading up to the IPCC's First Assessment Report which reviewed the most recent climate science research. In October 1989, The IPA Review published an unattributed editorial entitled \u201cThe Green Messiah\u201d which suggests that concerns about the enhanced Greenhouse Effect are overstated and based not on a scientifically identified problem, but on religious motivations. The argument is made that the \u201cGreen Messiah\u201d (environmentalism) and its by-products such as climate science are filling the voids left by the decline of traditional religion: [W]ith the declining capacity of the traditional churches to satisfy the religious yearnings of people \u2026 such yearnings are seeking other outlets. The birth of a modern form of pantheism (nature worship) in the rise of the environmental movement may be one such outlet \u2026 The problem is to decide where science ends and faith begins: how seriously should we take the prophets of environmental doom?

(IPA, 1989, p. 4)", "The editorial is also the earliest example of the IPA's conflation of climate scientists with environmental activists. One clear example of this combined fantasy theme chaining out is an op-ed entitled \u201cSceptics, the Environment Needs You\u201d, published by Jennifer Marohasy (a biologist and former director of the IPA front group, the Australian Environment Foundation) in The Age newspaper in 2004. Marohasy labels the environmental movement a \u201cnew religion\u201d of \u201cenvironmental doomsayers\u201d whose concerns are not based on scientific evidence: [E]nvironmentalism is emerging as a new religion, with Greenpeace, the World Wide Fund for Nature and the World Wildlife Fund representing the new church \u2026 let us move forward on the basis of the evidence, rather than the failed predictions of our environmental doomsayers.

(Marohasy, 2004)", "The IPA's religious fantasy themes continued to chain out via editorials and opinion columns when IPA associate Plimer's book was launched in April 2009. The Weekend Australian conservative newspaper ran an editorial under the headline \u201cMore Heat Than Light\u201d which argues that concerns about climate change are not based on science but the zealotry of environmental activists. With its clear religious and persecutory overtones\u2014for example, its use of the word \u201cheresy\u2019\u2014the editorial hints at the \u201cPlimer as Galileo\u201d fantasy theme as well. It also explicitly reconstructs climate science as a \u201cfaith-based\u201d rather than an evidence-based pursuit: For environmental activists, any suggestion prophecies of planetary peril should be considered carefully is heresy \u2026 to assume we know how much the planet will warm this century and what effect this will have is a matter of faith, not reason. And faith-based research is less science than secular religion.

(The Australian, 2009b)", "This editorial also directs readers to an opinion piece written by the paper's Adelaide bureau chief, Jamie Walker, who favourably reviewed Plimer's book.", "In this 1600-word opinion piece entitled \u201cThe Climate of Consensus is Precipitating a Disaster for Science\u201d, Walker (2009) reduces the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change to a mere \u201cassumption\u201d that forms the basis of \u201ccatastrophic consequences talked up by the doom-and-gloom merchants\u201d. He also conjures a religious image of \u201c[then Australian Prime Minister] Kevin Rudd, [paleontologist] Tim Flannery and former US vice-president Al Gore singing from the same hymn sheet about the hydra-headed menace of global warming\u201d. Walker then clearly invokes the \u201cClimate Science as Religion\u201d fantasy theme by quoting Plimer's book\u2014\u201cGlobal warming has become the secular religion of today\u201d\u2014and including excerpts from his interview with Plimer, who conflates climate scientists and environmental activists into a single category of \u201creligious fundamentalists\u201d akin to creationists: \u201cThe creationists were trying to teach a religious fundamentalism dressed up as science\u2009\u2026 and they totally changed the nature science,\u201d [Plimer] says \u2026 \u201cSo I make great comparison between the way creationists operate and the way some of the rabid environmentalists and global warmers operate.\u201d (Plimer, cited in Walker, 2009)  ", "\u201cThe creationists were trying to teach a religious fundamentalism dressed up as science\u2009\u2026 and they totally changed the nature science,\u201d [Plimer] says \u2026 \u201cSo I make great comparison between the way creationists operate and the way some of the rabid environmentalists and global warmers operate.\u201d (Plimer, cited in Walker, 2009)", "A few pages away in the same edition of The Weekend Australian, opinion columnist Christopher Pearson wrote that he would be \u201chonoured to serve as the master of ceremonies\u201d at the Adelaide launch of Plimer's book the following week. In his 1300-word review of Plimer's book, \u201cSceptic Spells Doom for Alarmist Religion\u201d, Pearson (2009) said that accepting the evidence of anthropogenic climate change \u201crequires many non-scientific leaps of faith\u201d and that the IPCC's stated 90 per cent (\u201cvery likely\u201d) level of certainty regarding the main driver of climate change is \u201ccomparable to 100 per cent certainty professed by religious devotees that theirs is the one and only true faith\u201d. Pearson also quotes Plimer's book, which references both religious fantasy themes and again conflates climate science with religion and scientists with activists: With some rabid environmentalists, human-induced global warming has evolved into a religious belief system \u2026 The new environmental religion embraces anti-human totalitarianism.

She says that \u201cclimate change has become a quasi-religious belief\u201d and praises Plimer's book as a \u201ccomprehensive scientific refutation of the beliefs underpinning the idea of human-caused climate change\u201d (emphasis added).", "On 29 May 2009, at the peak of news coverage of his book in Australia, Plimer himself published an op-ed in The Australian newspaper. Drawing on the strong opposition to the Rudd government's proposed ETS in Australia's regional areas, Plimer argues that climate science and mitigation strategies are being promoted by city-based \u201catheist\u201d religious \u201cfundamentalists\u2019: [T]here are a large number of punters who object to being treated dismissively as stupid, who do not like being told what to think, who value independence, who resile from personal attacks and have life experiences very different from the urban environmental atheists attempting to impose a new fundamentalist religion.

In one op-ed published in The Courier-Mail in 2000, Ron Brunton (an anthropologist and former head of the IPA's Environmental Policy Unit) combines the tactic of conflating the environmental movement and climate scientists with allegations of rent-seeking behaviour. In this op-ed, Brunton accuses climate scientists (among others) of \u201ccashing in\u201d on the \u201cnew industry\u201d that had been created by stoking the public's fears about the potential consequences of global warming: A new global industry has been built around the greenhouse effect, as scientists, environmentalists, bureaucrats and others seek to cash in on public fears about global warming.

In 2003, The IPA Review published an article entitled \u201cScience is Not Consensus\u201d by Bob Carter, a marine geologist and founding member of the IPA front groups, the Australian Environment Foundation (AEF) and the Australian Climate Science Coalition (ACSC). In this article, Carter joins forces with American sceptics who were escalating their attacks on climate scientists and the scientific consensus; here, he quotes a former President of the Mineralogical Society of America: \u201cThe idea that humans have significantly enhanced global warming is by far the most massive abuse of science that I have ever seen\u201d (Ross, in Carter, 2003, p. 13). Carter's own inflammatory rhetoric compares scientists to \u201csex workers\u201d and accuses the entire field of climate scientists of fabricating environmental threats to procure government funding: To capture government's attention, and funding, requires the generation of a crisis in one of these politically sensitive areas \u2026 Thus did our venerable handmaiden, science, become a sex-worker.

His claims are supported by (former) IPA Executive Director Mike Nahan. In his editorial, \u201cThe Demise of Science\u201d, published in the same issue of The IPA Review, Nahan agrees with Carter that climate scientists have become \u201cmyth-makers\u201d who have abandoned the pursuit of the truth for the pursuit of funding: The question is: why have so many scientists also succumbed to being myth-makers? One answer is money. Shock and horror not only sells papers and generates donations for NGOs, it also generates funding for research.

The rhetorical vision expressed by the IPA is one of hostility towards climate scientists and the scientific consensus on climate change; the IPA's hostility is based on its opposition to proposed government regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "The distinct fantasy themes identified in this analysis were traced as they chained out from The IPA Review to op-eds published by IPA senior staff in major newspapers and through opinion columns written by conservative members of the press. Australian conservative columnists continue to take their lead on the issue of climate change from the IPA (Pearse, 2007), readily repeating the IPA's fantasy themes. This study also supports the conclusion of Carvalho (2007) that ideology is a primary factor that determines the news media's representation of scientific knowledge about climate change and the selection of \u201cexperts\u201d who are given a voice. Plimer received by far the most favourable press from the editors of conservative newspapers and conservative opinion columnists, while the most unfavourable coverage originated with scientists and science and environment reporters.", "The IPA's fantasy themes contained in a book written by an IPA associate scholar were given high-profile media coverage in major Australian newspapers in the lead-up to the historic debate in the Australian parliament about introducing an ETS; this is consistent with the conclusion of Jacques et al. (2008) that neoliberal think tanks tend to launch environmentally \u201csceptical\u201d books in the lead-up to major debates on environmental policy, in an effort to influence the policy process.", "Even the IPA's associate scholars such as Plimer and Carter devote a considerable proportion of their IPA Review articles, op-eds, media interviews and books to deploying the IPA's fantasy themes, or \u201crhetorical arsenal\u201d (Cahill, 2004, p. 270), which they use to vilify, demonise and delegitimate climate scientists and other citizens who accept the scientific consensus and the need for action on climate change. Fantasy Theme Analysis provides an especially useful structure for identifying and examining the distinctive \u201ctalking points\u201d used by neoliberal think tanks and their associates in their efforts to delegitimate climate scientists. In particular, the fantasy themes are key to answering the three main questions posed by Fairclough (1995) to discourse analysts.", "Firstly, how is reality represented in the text? The fantasy themes dramatise the IPA's interpretation of reality, in which communism and the Judeo-Christian tradition have been replaced in the West with the irrational, quasi-religious environmental movement that advances a leftist political agenda of government intervention. In this reality, climate scientists have been co-opted into the \u201creligious\u201d order and now form a powerful, self-serving elite that does not tolerate dissenting views. This interpretation of reality enables the IPA to argue that its contrarian views on climate change are correct yet silenced by a corrupt establishment\u2014their associate scholars are not scientifically irrelevant, they are modern-day Galileos exposing the truth about the fabrication of anthropogenic climate change, which is fuelling a money-spinning scam in the form of higher taxes and the trading of carbon credits.", "Secondly, what identities are set up for those involved in the story? Fantasy themes use stock characters such as villains, heroes and victims to construct dramatic narratives. Climate scientists are clearly the villains: rent-seeking, dissent-stifling, Ivory Tower elitists who readily commit scientific fraud for financial gain. The fantasy themes also repeatedly conflate climate scientists and the environmental lobby\u2014thus reconstructing the identity of climate scientists as environmental activists. Boykoff and Mansfield (2008) found that conservative tabloid opinion columnists in the United Kingdom use similar rhetorical tactics. Meanwhile, contrarian scientists are cast as the heroes who risk persecution, like Galileo, to expose the flaws in the prevailing orthodoxy. Finally, the general public are cast as \u201chelpless and disenfranchised\u201d victims blinded by the science and forced to bear the burden of government policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through lost jobs and financial hardship.", "Thirdly, what relationships are set up between those involved? The fantasy themes construct two distinct relationships of unequal power, and a third relationship of empowerment. In the first instance, there is the adversarial relationship set up between the scientific \u201celite\u201d and the \u201cdissidents\u201d they \u201cpersecute\u201d, with climate scientists commanding the field of climate science by monopolising government research funding and colluding with their peers to keep the work of dissident scientists out of prestigious journals. In the second instance, there is the exploitative relationship set up between the \u201crent-seeking Ivory Tower elites\u201d and ordinary citizens who fund research that is based on \u201cscientific fraud\u201d. In this relationship, the general public are \u201cconned\u201d and \u201cfrightened witless\u201d by fabricated threats and forced to endure financial hardship resulting from policy based on religious and ideological propaganda. This contrasts sharply with the third relationship of empowerment set up by the fantasy themes between ordinary citizens and contrarian scientists such as Plimer, the People's Scientist, who stands up to the oppressive establishment and offers a truth-telling accessible book to the \u201cpunters\u201d which contains \u201call the scientific ammunition they could want\u201d (Pearson, 2009).", "Finally, there are important social identities and relationships inherent in the production and consumption of media texts. The IPA functions as the font of a coherent rhetorical vision for ideologically conservative editors and columnists, who then present themselves as figures of authority to their readers\u2014opinion columnists are people who have \u201cthe facts\u201d and the \u201cright to tell\u201d. Their authoritative, lecturing style of communication enhances their authority and establishes a relationship of unequal power\u2014nevertheless one of trust\u2014with their readers, who are assumed to be \u201creceptive, waiting to be told, wanting to know\u201d (Fairclough, 1995, p. 4). Thus, newspaper editorials and opinion columns which use the IPA's fantasy themes increase the likelihood that readers will form a distrust of climate scientists, climate science, policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and citizens who support those policies.
