Drawing on the perspective of social capital, this study examines whether social media use, social network, social capital, and civic skills help to predict the degree of engagement in producing citizen journalism, especially on Twitter and Facebook. Findings demonstrate that bridging capital\u2014connecting to gain new ideas and experiences\u2014was a powerful predictor of citizen journalism activities on Facebook, whereas bonding capital\u2014connecting with close, trusted acquaintances\u2014strongly predicted less citizen journalism activity.

While prior literature on citizen journalism in trade publications and academic scholarship has tended to focus on citizen news websites and blogs, citizen journalism activity through social media such as Facebook and Twitter is becoming increasingly relevant and important. According to a September 2013 Pew Research Center survey, 71 percent of online adults report using Facebook, 18 percent report using Twitter, and Facebook and Twitter use has increased dramatically since 2010 (Pew Research Center 2014). Hermida (2009) suggested social media creates a new form of citizen journalism that is different from institutional journalism. This study expands the discussion of citizen journalism to these types of outlets.", "The question of the boundaries of citizen journalism is related to questions about new forms and practices of news production in the digital age (Lewis, Kaufhold, and Lasorsa 2010). In the traditional news production setting, news outlets have produced via the routines of gatekeeping: \u201cselecting, writing, editing, positioning, scheduling, repeating and otherwise massaging of information\u201d (Shoemaker, Vos, and Reese 2008, 73). However, in a digital news production context, customary boundaries of news producers and news consumers are blurred, and technically, anyone can engage in news production and distribution (Benkler 2006; Bruns 2008; Jenkins 2006). This increases uncertainty about journalists\u2019 roles (Bruns 2005; Shoemaker and Vos 2009), and prior studies have focused on how the digital environment threatens the traditional journalism gatekeeping function (Benkler 2006; Bruns 2008; Goode 2009; Jenkins 2006; Lewis, Kaufhold, and Lasorsa 2010; Williams and Carpini 2004), and challenges journalists\u2019 values (Carpenter 2010; Joyce 2007; Kaufhold, Valenzuela, and De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2010; Pease 1990; Singer 2003), journalists\u2019 norms (Deuze 2005; Lewis, Kaufhold, and Lasorsa 2010; Robinson 2007; Singer 2003, 2005), and journalists\u2019 practices (McDevitt, Gassaway, and P\u00e9rez 2002; Rosen 2008). A trenchant concern is that citizen journalists tend to lack professional news training and that commons-based peer news production may diminish accuracy (The Huffington Post, November 6, 2012).", "Uncertainties and concerns over blurred boundaries suggest a need to explore contexts for the production of citizen journalism and to clarify how these may differ from the contexts for traditional news production. Also, more clarity is needed about the differences between citizen journalism and everyday user-generated content, and we need a clearer understanding about the contexts for these differences. Few studies have examined the antecedents or social contexts for citizen journalism production. This study seeks to identify differences between citizen journalists and general media users, in a US context, and to shed light on the social contexts and determinants that encourage individual\u2019s engagement in citizen journalism tasks. In particular, the study examines whether different types of social media use, social networking, social capital, and civic skills help to predict degree of engagement in production of citizen journalism."]}, {"title": "Boundaries of Citizen Journalism", "paragraphs": ["The rise of citizen journalism is grounded in the civic and public journalism \u201creform\u201d movement in the late 1980s and grew with the proliferation of the internet (Flew and Wilson 2010; Kperogi 2011; Massey and Haas 2002). The reform movement advocated that news media should \u201cgo beyond the mere reporting of information to act as a catalyst and as a forum for the revitalization of democracy\u201d (McDevitt, Gassaway, and P\u00e9rez 2002, 87). The goal was to encourage the public to increase interest and participation in civic affairs (Massey and Haas 2002). The advent of the internet stimulated such efforts, as it lowered barriers to production and made it easier to produce journalism-like public messages without professional journalistic norms and training (Salawu 2011). Networking technologies such as blogs, mobile computing, and social media facilitate users\u2019 active participation and interaction, and facilitate engagement in public issues (Johnson and Perlmutter 2010; Salawu 2011; Woolley, Limperos, and Oliver 2010).", "Professional news content is generally thought to be \u201cproduced by paid, trained, and supervised journalists via news media outlets including newspapers, television, radio, and the Internet\u201d (Kaufhold, Valenzuela, and De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2010, 517). Professional journalists are typically thought of as those working within established organizational settings and within established journalistic routines and norms (Kaufhold, Valenzuela, and De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2010; Lowrey 2006; Shoemaker, Vos, and Reese 2008). Professional journalism, particularly in the United States and Britain, formally values accuracy and objectivity in news-gathering processes that serve news organizations (e.g., Society of Professional Journalists 2013). Conversely, citizen journalism is most often associated with unpaid, untrained journalists who participate in Web-based journalistic practices (Goode 2009; Kaufhold, Valenzuela, and De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2010), thus blurring the line between journalists and audience, between the creator and the consumer of news and information (Benkler 2006; Bruns 2008; Jenkins 2006). Citizen journalists may engage in news-making and news-use processes such as issue selecting, collecting, reporting, disseminating, and sharing for the purpose of informing others of knowledge and information; however, these processes are often unsystematic, as they lack widely agreed-upon principles and guidelines for practice (Bowman and Willis 2003; Kaufhold, Valenzuela, and De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2010; Rosen 2008).", "There have been efforts to systematize and typify individual-level online production. Domingo and Heinonen (2008) identified four types of journalistic blogs: the audience blog, the journalist blog, the media blog, and the citizen blog. According to this typology, audience blogs are produced by news audiences but are published within mainstream media, and journalist blogs are produced by journalists outside their media institution. Media blogs, the most institutionalized forms of journalistic blogs, are produced by professional journalists within their media companies. By contrast, citizen bloggers do not have the resources and routines of professional journalism and produce blogs on their own, outside the mainstream media, making them the least institutionalized form. Nip (2006) distinguished citizen journalism from traditional journalism via a taxonomy of journalistic forms: traditional journalism, interactive journalism, public journalism, and participatory journalism. In traditional journalism, only professional journalists play a part in the gatekeeping process. Interactive journalism includes users\u2019 content that is often produced in response to professional journalists\u2019 stories. Public journalism (similar to civic journalism) emerged as a way to overcome the disconnect between mainstream journalism and the public; it allows the public to participate in news gathering, producing and sharing the news, although professional journalists still maintain gatekeeping control. In participatory journalism, mainstream journalists embrace news, ideas, and information generated by users. While participatory and citizen journalism are close in form, Nip sees a difference. Participatory journalism suggests interactivity between citizens and professional journalists, while in citizen journalism, an individual, a group, or a nonprofit organization can generate news content without involvement from paid, trained professionals. As Salawu (2011, 185) put it, citizen journalism is a \u201cjournalism of the people, by the people, and for the people.\u201d", "In general then, prior studies describe citizen journalism as a counterpart of traditional or professional journalism that does not rely on the traditional systematic organization of production in the news-making process or on journalistic values and norms such as objectivity, accuracy, and fairness. Citizen journalism involves active public participation by non-journalists outside of media organizations, who can engage in news-making and news-gathering processes without traditional journalistic routines and norms. However, like traditional journalism, citizen journalism focuses primarily on issues and events that are relevant within a public context rather than a personal context. The content of citizen journalism is relevant to democratic governance, though this relevance is variable (Lowrey 2012). Many other scholars have also claimed that citizen journalism may contribute to the public sphere and democracy (e.g., Allan 2006; Gillmor 2004; Robinson 2009; Thurman 2008; Tremayne 2006).", "There is also the question of the distinction between citizen journalists and an increasingly Web-savvy general audience. Evidence demonstrates that social media play an increasingly important role in journalism because users of these media find events journalists do not know about, and they foster ideas of community and \u201cthe local\u201d among users (Hess 2013; Richards 2013). We suggest that the public is engaging in citizen journalism to the degree that the public participates in gathering, providing, and using publicly relevant information. This study defines \u201ccitizen journalism content\u201d as content that is relevant to a \u201cpublic\u201d and that has political purpose. While public issues need not be political in nature, this study focuses on political communication because it connects with political machinery that facilitates public action on such messages. This political focus is also consistent with prior research on media\u2013community interaction (e.g., literature on civic and public journalism).", "As suggested by previous studies on citizen journalism that emphasize the role of active political participation and democratic skills in invigorating deliberative discussion, active users of social media and people who have more civic skills and knowledge should be more likely to produce citizen journalism content. Thus, in addition to social media use, the extent of users\u2019 civic skills\u2014i.e., cognitive and participatory skills that enable us to understand and evaluate knowledge of public issues (national or local)\u2014should correlate positively with engagement in citizen journalism activities such as posting and responding to politically oriented public messages.", "While we would expect that greater use of social media would correlate positively with increased citizen journalism activity via social media, the strength of these correlations is unknown. It is also unknown which types of citizen journalism participation correlates with most strongly. Therefore, these relationships are proposed formally (in hypotheses H1, H1a, and H1b, below). Less obvious is the potential impact of the type of social media. Not all social media are alike, and so we would expect that activities on the social media platform Facebook differ from activities on the social media platform Twitter. Facebook is designed to facilitate interpersonal relationships in a way that Twitter is not, and this may have an impact on the degree to which individuals assert themselves politically versus responding to others\u2019 political comments. However, differences between the two have been little explored and are unclear. Therefore, while Facebook and Twitter will be analyzed separately, differences in effects between the two will not be predicted. The following hypotheses are proposed:People who spend more time using social media will participate more in citizen journalism activities.People who spend more time using Facebook will participate more in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.People who spend more time using Twitter will participate more in citizen journalism activities on Twitter.People who have more civic skills will participate more in citizen journalism activities.People who have more civic skills will participate more in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.People who have more civic skills will participate more in citizen journalism activities on Twitter.", "People who spend more time using social media will participate more in citizen journalism activities.", "People who spend more time using Facebook will participate more in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.", "People who spend more time using Twitter will participate more in citizen journalism activities on Twitter.", "People who have more civic skills will participate more in citizen journalism activities.", "People who have more civic skills will participate more in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.", "People who have more civic skills will participate more in citizen journalism activities on Twitter."]}, {"title": "Social Capital and Citizen Journalists", "paragraphs": ["In order to identify social-level predictors of citizen journalists\u2019 engagement in a social media context, social capital theory is employed. Social capital theory explains how media usage influences social networks and other activities that contribute to the health and effectiveness of a democracy (Putnam and Goss 2002). Scholars have shown that the use of social media might foster social capital and further increase civic engagement because it can encourage and reshape social networks and relationships at a small cost (Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe 2007). Further, Woolcock and Sweetser (2002, 26) argued that \u201clinking social capital pertains to connections with people in power, whether they are in politically or financially influential positions.\u201d Thus, social capital from social media would help to explain the likelihood of engaging in citizen journalism activity, because individuals who have built up considerable social capital in a community are more likely to have strong interactive relationships and \u201creciprocity\u201d between themselves and the political-economic machinery\u2014i.e., public entities, such as officials, businesses, and other media workers. This would make it easier for them to obtain source information and advertising and to find freelance writers for their site if they need more content to make news. In this sense, social capital theory may help to explain the sort of context needed for the emergence, development, and maintenance of citizen journalism news outlets.", "Bourdieu and Coleman have identified how social norms are associated with different kinds of capital such as financial or human capital on the basis of relationships. Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992, 14) regard social capital as the sum of the resources that result from \u201cpossessing a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.\u201d This is similar to Coleman\u2019s (1988) definition of social capital as the aggregate of the resources embedded in the relationships among people. Putnam (1995, 664) focused on individual and community levels of social capital\u2014those \u201cfeatures of social life-networks, norms, and trust\u201d\u2014as the basis of civic engagement. He said the stronger and more extensive our social networks, the more we may trust one another and experience reciprocity, and thus build strong, trusting communities with high levels of civic participation.", "The core reasoning is that individuals with larger and more diverse networks would have more social capital than those with smaller and less diverse networks (Valenzuela, Park, and Kee 2009). Larger networks lead to increased social capital based on more and different types of resources because increased social interaction and opportunity to access information may develop norms of trust and reciprocity and therefore elicit successful civic engagement (Lin 2002). In an interactive social media network, citizen journalists can engage in journalistic activities such as content creating or content sharing through posting, blogging, tagging, liking, commenting, and so forth. A content analysis and case study by Robinson and colleagues (i.e., Robinson 2009; Robinson and Deshano 2011) suggested that people\u2019s social networks can promote citizen journalistic activities, but few studies have quantitatively investigated the relationship between network size and citizen journalism activities. We propose that network size may affect the likelihood of engaging in citizen journalism. The following hypotheses are proposed:People who have larger networks will participate more often in citizen journalism activities.People who have larger network size on Facebook will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.People who have larger network size on Twitter will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Twitter.", "People who have larger networks will participate more often in citizen journalism activities.", "People who have larger network size on Facebook will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.", "People who have larger network size on Twitter will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Twitter.", "Putnam (2000) classified individual and community levels of social capital as two different forms: bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital represents benefits from \u201cstrong ties\u201d or tightly knit relationships such as family and close friends, which include emotional or tangible support. Like bonding social capital, bridging social capital describes benefits from relationships but relies on \u201cweak ties,\u201d which are distant and loose connections such as acquaintances that may not provide emotional support, but that are more likely to lead to new ideas and opportunities (Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe 2007; Gilbert and Karahalios 2009).", "Several scholars (Ellison et al. 2007; Steinfield, Ellison, and Lampe 2008) have found social media to be positively related to both bridging and bonding social capital although bridging social capital is better predicted than bonding social capital. Although previous studies have searched for a link between social media use and the level of social capital, the specific kinds of civic or political activities social media produce are not clear. Given that bonding social capital is based on \u201cstrong ties\u201d or tightly knit relationships, while bridging social capital relies on \u201cweak ties\u201d or distant, loose connections, they may influence citizen journalism activities differently. For example, bridging capital may be ideal for accessing new ideas, innovations, and additional resources outside the individual\u2019s immediate circle of acquaintances. This is because individuals with a wide social network with many connections may look more legitimate to sources such as a government official or a potential commercial advertiser than those with small networks. By contrast, bonding capital may aid the cohesiveness, stability, and trust in citizen journalists\u2019 relationships, and this can aid the news-making process. Hence, the following hypotheses are proposed:People who have more bonding social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities.People who have more bonding social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.People who have more bonding social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Twitter.People who have more bridging social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities.People who have more bridging social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.People who have more bridging social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Twitter.", "People who have more bonding social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities.", "People who have more bonding social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.", "People who have more bonding social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Twitter.", "People who have more bridging social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities.", "People who have more bridging social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Facebook.", "People who have more bridging social capital will participate more often in citizen journalism activities on Twitter."]}, {"title": "Methods", "paragraphs": ["A Web-based national survey was conducted from October 23 through November 20, 2012.

Findings here shed light on this question by testing the impact of various civic, social, and online contexts for citizen journalism activity. Findings indicate that those engaged in online citizen journalism value public communication over relationship building. The use of social media for relationship \u201cbonding\u201d\u2014something Facebook lends itself to\u2014did not encourage citizen journalism activity online, while \u201cbridging\u201d to more distant connections did encourage this activity. The social media context\u2014Facebook versus Twitter\u2014also has a real impact on citizen journalism activity, as Twitter is the preference for active public communication and for those who are already civically inclined.", "Overall, study findings showed that conceptual predictions were partially supported. In particular, specific relationships were seen between personal factors (e.g., social media use and civic skills) and social factors (network size as well as bonding and bridging social capital), on the one hand, and political-oriented citizen journalism activities, on the other. The social factors of network size and bonding and bridging social capital were the most powerful predictors of citizen journalism activities on Facebook, whereas personal factors including social media use and civic skills were the most powerful predictors of citizen journalism activities on Twitter (see values of R2 change on Tables 1 and 2).", "H1 predicted that people who spend more time using social media will participate more in citizen journalism activities. As mentioned earlier, this is not surprising, given that increased \u201cpolitical\u201d activity is likely to be a consequence of increased use overall. However, the findings differentiating Facebook from Twitter use were interesting. Findings showed that Facebook use positively affects only the activity of responding to others\u2019 political views on Facebook, while Twitter use positively affects all of the citizen journalism activities on Twitter. This implies that political citizen journalism activities on social media do not merely mirror general use of social media. Twitter use is related to engagement in more active civic journalism behaviors, while Facebook use itself is minimally connected to citizen journalism activities.", "H2 posited that people who have more civic skills will participate more in citizen journalism activities. The findings indicated that civic skills have a positive influence on only one of the citizen journalism activities on Facebook (i.e., reading others\u2019 political opinions), but three of those activities on Twitter (i.e., posting political messages, retweeting others\u2019 political opinion, and reading others\u2019 political opinion). These findings suggest that on Facebook, a personal and relationship-based space, citizens\u2019 civic skills play a role in understanding and evaluating others\u2019 opinions as they participate in reading activities. By contrast, Twitter is a more public and open communication space in which civic skills may facilitate active and participatory journalism activity beyond just a passive \u201cmonitoring\u201d activity.", "H3 predicted that people who have larger networks will participate more often in citizen journalism activities. However, no statistical significance was found in citizen journalism activities on Facebook, and only one positive relationship with the activity of retweeting others\u2019 political opinion was found for Twitter. These unexpected findings suggest that having larger networks indicates little more than that a person is interested in building and keeping up with relationships in general. That is, larger networks on social media do not seem to foster citizen journalism activities on social media. It is possible that offline network size would show different relationships with citizen journalism activities. However, this issue is beyond the scope of this study. Future studies may shed some light.", "H4 and H5 predicted bonding and bridging social capital as positive predictors of citizen journalism activities. Interestingly, the findings showed that bonding social capital is negatively related to citizen journalism activities except for reading others\u2019 opinions on both Facebook and Twitter. By contrast, bridging social capital is positively related to all citizen journalism activities on both Facebook and to active journalism activities on Twitter, such as posting political messages and replying to others\u2019 political opinion. This suggests that relationships based on strong ties or tightly knit connections may not be positively related to citizen journalism activities on social media. Rather, people who try to find new ideas and friends based on the distant and loose connections may more actively participate in journalism activities on social media. Given that Facebook is more relationship-oriented than Twitter, and is based more on formal agreement or symmetrical relationships between users (Porter 2009), it is not surprising that strong and positive links between bridging social capital and citizen journalism activities were found on Facebook. The connection between relationship-oriented characteristics of media and social capital still remains unclear in the literature, and future research should help resolve this issue by comparing different types of media based on relationship orientation and social capital. Nevertheless, these findings reveal that social capital is an important predictor of citizen journalism activities.", "Most demographic variables do not predict citizen journalism activities except for gender and age. Gender was positively related to several citizen journalism activities on Facebook, while age was the only negatively related variable to one citizen journalism activity on Twitter. Specifically, females tended to post more political messages and post more responses on others\u2019 political views on Facebook than males, and younger people tended to read more of others\u2019 political opinions on Twitter. The finding on youth suggests an increasingly important role for social media in political communication, assuming media use routines persist with aging.", "There are several limitations in this study, one being the convenience sampling method, which limits generalization. Future studies based on random sampling in various media, organization, and cultural contexts would help confirm this study\u2019s findings. Second, measurements of key variables such as citizen journalism activities are limited. This study sought to identify determinants of citizen journalism in the social media environment. However, the boundaries of citizen journalism are still blurred, and there has not been a consensus on the definition of citizen journalism. To mitigate this weakness, citizen journalism activities were measured using instruments based on prior studies of citizen journalism activities in social media. However, more questions such as \u201chow citizen journalists create and share content\u201d and \u201cwhether citizen journalism activities lie in non-political communication\u201d still remain unanswered. To further validate this measurement, future investigation of the instruments to measure the terms such as citizen journalism and its journalism activities are needed. In a similar vein, this study focused on the relationships between determinants of citizen journalism and individual\u2019s citizen journalism activities. However, how people actually increase the determinants of these activities (e.g., civic skills, network size, and bonding and bridging social capital) still remains unknown. This question is beyond our scope of the research. Thus, future study that explains how people build the determinants of citizen journalism would broaden the knowledge of citizen journalism. Finally, the data were collected before and after the 2012 presidential election in the United States, and this time frame may have affected citizen journalism activities. Although this time frame is helpful for examining the role of citizen journalism activities as facilitators of democratic discussion, more people presumably participate in those activities than they do during non-election times. Future studies in the non-election setting should review and replicate the findings of this study."]}], "references": [{"title": "A Study of Content Diversity in Online Citizen Journalism and Online Newspaper Articles", "year": "2010", "journal": "New Media \\& Society", "volume": "12", "authors": [{"name": "Carpenter Serena", "first_name": "Carpenter", "last_name": "Serena"}]}, {"title": "Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital", "year": "1988", "journal": "American Journal of Sociology", "volume": "94", "authors": [{"name": "Coleman James.
