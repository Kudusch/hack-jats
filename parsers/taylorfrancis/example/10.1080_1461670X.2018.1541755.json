They exercised a notable degree of autonomy in a field where the discourse of autonomy is rampant but the practice of autonomy is rare, where workaday journalists restrict their own behavior not to obey rules or laws, but to conform with unwritten expectations circumscribing the words and deeds they may enact. These legendary newspeople performed a key paradox of journalism, which Schudson (1978, 80) observed as \u201ca theme in the memoirs of reporters: that the rules one learned as a beginner one had to unlearn to stand out\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d", "The purpose of this study is to make explicit the paradox in U.S. journalism discourse whereby journalists are taught to express and defend nearly complete freedom of judgment and, simultaneously, to constrain such judgment to meet the narrow, often unspoken common-sense expectations of their professional peers and other social groups. To do so, I analyze 75 introductory U.S. journalism textbooks spanning the birth of formal journalism education at the turn of the twentieth century through the present era. Journalism textbooks constitute a key site of (re)construction of journalistic subjectivities (Vos 2012; Mari 2015), setting many new reporters and editors on a cultural course they carry into the profession. I analyze these texts through the social theory of Michel Foucault, specifically his concept of discipline ([1975] 1995), to help explain the conditions under which practicing journalists internalize contradictory expectations and constrain their perceived freedom even in the absence of formal requirements to do so. I also draw on Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s complementary concept of habitus to explicate the discursive milieu in which discipline operates. Making explicit the contradictions that muddle journalistic decisionmaking and the mechanisms through which such contradictions persist can help scholars and journalists better understand news choices and reflect on alternative approaches to common-sense disciplinary routines."]}, {"sec_title": "The Allure of Autonomy", "sec_content": ["Journalism as a field is quick to assert its autonomy from other fields or influences. The scholarly literature on journalism autonomy is complex, but it usually begins with journalists\u2019 insistence that they must be free to decide who and what to cover, when, and how, based on their own professional judgment without the interference of political pressure, publisher preference, or economic demands. In the U.S., the press is protected by the founding Constitution\u2019s First Amendment, which prohibits Congress from abridging press freedom and provides a normative basis for aggressive defense of this freedom (Buozis, Rooney, and Creech 2018). McDevitt (2003, 156) notes, \u201c[T]he dynamics of professional socialization predispose journalists to guardedly protect their independence.\u201d And Singer (2007, 81) writes, \u201cJournalists, particularly in the United States, have made independence a part of their ethical code\u2009\u2026\u2009and have fiercely fought any attempts, real or perceived, to encroach on this autonomy.\u201d", "While Singer (2007) links journalistic autonomy with professionalism and notions of accountability; and McDevitt (2003, 156) considers autonomy \u201ca multidimensional orientation\u201d encompassing objectivity, professional identity, and \u201cthe possibility for critical reflection\u201d; other scholars note that journalists often deploy autonomy as a shield against critique. Journalists \u201ctend to eschew and deride\u201d codified ethical standards (Zelizer 2017, 84\u201385). Most \u201cdefine any demand for accountability\u2009\u2026\u2009as a violation of the sanctity of the newsroom\u201d (Glasser and Gunther 2005, 389). They practice with what Zelizer calls journalism\u2019s \u201cseemingly untouchable authority: its reliance on practices that unfold largely behind closed doors; its insistence on power without commensurate degrees of accountability\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d (Zelizer 2017, 103).", "Other intertwined dimensions of autonomy include the collective autonomy of the journalistic field and the localized freedom of individual journalists to apply personal judgment in discrete circumstances. \u201c[W]hile the profession itself seeks to exercise autonomy from outside control, individual professionals actually give up personal autonomy to a significant degree\u201d (Singer 2007, 81, emphasis added) through participation in newsroom routines that standardize and circumscribe their work. Singer\u2019s phrase \u201cgive up\u201d is important, because it suggests that individual journalists are complicit in constraints on their professional freedom. Glasser and Gunther (2005) similarly suggest that journalists often cede back their independence. They note, first, that [American] journalists accentuate forms of control that place power precisely where journalists want it: at the level of the individual journalist[s]\u2009\u2026\u2009[who] alone decide how to write their stories, which sources to contact, what quotes to use, and so on (390).But they further argue that such power is subordinate to \u201cthe power associated with the allocative decisions that determine basic policies, long-term goals, and the general disposition of resources\u201d (390). They conclude that the \u201cmost insidious manifestation of the influence of allocative decisions on operational autonomy [is] self-censorship\u201d (392).", "[American] journalists accentuate forms of control that place power precisely where journalists want it: at the level of the individual journalist[s]\u2009\u2026\u2009[who] alone decide how to write their stories, which sources to contact, what quotes to use, and so on (390).", "Such self-enforced discipline arises from constant reminders within journalistic discourse of what common sense (but not firm rules of conduct) dictates journalists must and can\u2019t do. Journalists, Zelizer (2017) argues, \u201clearn by osmosis\u2009\u2026\u2009Their conventions and collective lore are embedded in routines that for the most part remain unarticulated and are informally and ritually passed among group members\u201d (244). This way of being resembles what Bourdieu (1977) calls habitus, the tenets of which are often self-enforced by individuals through what Foucault calls technologies of discipline: People, always aware or concerned that they\u2019re being watched, regulate their behavior to conform to their perceptions of others\u2019 expectations \u2013 whether they have to or not. These theories of Foucault and Bourdieu are elaborated below."]}, {"sec_title": "Foucault, Discipline, and Journalism", "sec_content": ["Foucault\u2019s work, on its face, could be regarded as the antithesis of modern journalism. If journalists in the model that emerged in the late nineteenth century are charged with uncovering and delivering the \u201ctruth,\u201d then any confrontation with Foucault, whose \u201cphilosophy strikes at the normalizing, limiting, disciplining effects that the search for truth has imposed on human creativity and imagination\u201d (Fendler 2010, 6\u20137), will be unsettling. Foucault has been applied to arguments that journalistic transparency can lead to self-regulation at the expense of autonomy (Allen 2008) and that journalists exercise disciplinary power over audiences by \u201csetting the parameters of normal and deviant behavior\u201d (Edy and Snidow 2011, 817). Andrejevic (2008) writes that \u201cthere is much to be gained from applying [Foucault\u2019s] arguments to questions of central importance to journalism studies,\u201d including \u201cnewsroom socialization \u2013 the disciplinary formation of professional journalists\u201d (613).", "This study emphasizes Foucault\u2019s approach to the manner in which individuals feel compelled to regulate their behavior due to the perception that they are under constant surveillance and social obligation. This is outlined in detail in Discipline and Punish ([1975] 1995), in which Foucault traces the emergence of disciplinary practices across numerous social venues \u2013 the prison, the military, the school system, the hospital \u2013 as the human body came to be seen as a site of knowledge that could facilitate control. A metaphor of this control is the panopticon: Jeremy Bentham\u2019s prison design, arranged with multiple stories of cells encircling a central tower, from which guards could view all activity without being seen. Foucault argues the effect is constant self-monitoring: Eventually the prisoners stop guessing whether they\u2019re being watched and simply behave as though they are. There is a centralizing logic to Foucault\u2019s use of the panopticon, in that the ambivalent gaze radiates from an architectural middle to locations on the periphery. But the exercise of power within this edifice is diffuse and multidirectional. First, it need not be a hierarchical authority observing from the tower, but could be the authority\u2019s \u201cfamily, his friends, his visitors\u2009\u2026\u2009Any individual, taken almost at random, can operate the machine.\u2009\u2026\u2009The more numerous these anonymous and temporary observers are, the greater\u2009\u2026\u2009[the inmate\u2019s] anxious awareness of being observed\u201d (Foucault [1975] 1995, 202). Second, the surveillance technology encompasses even the facility\u2019s administrator, whose \u201cown fate [is] entirely bound up with it\u201d (204). Hence: He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection (203).In this way, discipline encompasses the manifold relations in which journalists find themselves: relations with peers, supervisors, corporate employers, and increasingly in the digital age (Anderson 2013), audiences. Journalists \u2013 reporters and their editors \u2013 are subject to a field of visibility, under the intermittent eye of an array of social actors, and they know it. As Allen (2008) writes, \u201cJurisdictional battles have increased surveillance to the point where traditional news outlets know they are being watched and act accordingly\u201d (335). The anticipation of being accused of falling short of pledged journalistic standards such as accuracy or \u201cobjectivity\u201d (Singer 2007) leads the journalist to pre-emptive behavior to ward off charges of unprofessionalism \u2013 self-imposed constraints that tend to maintain the hegemony of dominant values and practices. The easiest way to avoid being singled out for ideological critique under conditions of legibility is to do the same thing other journalists do: \u201c[T]he reporter is haunted by the professional necessity to validate his news sense\u2009\u2026\u2009by making the same judgments about news as his professional colleagues make\u201d (Cohen 1963).", "He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection (203).", "Foucault describes the discipline that arises from legibility as \u201coperat[ing] four great techniques: it draws up tables; it prescribes movements; it imposes exercises;\u2009\u2026\u2009it arranges tactics\u201d (167). Journalists, of course, have worked to timetables since the halting beginnings of the Western periodical press in the early seventeenth century (Pettegree 2014), and increasingly so since the invention of the steam press and the growth of daily newspapering in the early nineteenth century (Dicken-Garcia 1989), the rise of broadcasting in the early twentieth, the introduction of the 24-hour cable news cycle in the 1980s, and, now, the perpetual deadline of the Internet age.", "Journalists\u2019 movements are inscribed in the routines that have stationed them at various official outposts \u2013 city hall, police headquarters, legislative offices, etc. \u2013 where trustworthy official sources reside and news events reliably occur (Tuchman 1978). Journalistic exercises include daily source checks for news tidbits, the display of \u201cbalance\u201d in obtaining the \u201cother side\u201d of any story, and the ritualistic production of stories, pages, broadcasts, blogs, and social media posts. These processes are filtered through countless instantaneous judgments informed by news values, the categorizing lens through which journalists consciously or unconsciously assess the newsworthiness of each incoming fact or opinion (Parks 2018). News values are enacted through \u201ctactics[:] the art of constructing, with located bodies, coded activities and trained aptitudes, mechanisms in which the product of the various forces is increased by their calculated combination\u201d (Foucault [1975] 1995, 167). Lippmann (1922) defines news itself on the basis of the state\u2019s mechanisms of legibility, to which journalists are constantly attuned: Wherever there is a good machinery of record, the modern news service works with great precision. There is one on the stock exchange\u2009\u2026\u2009There is a machinery for election returns\u2009\u2026\u2009In civilized communities deaths, births, marriages and divorces are recorded.\u2009\u2026\u2009It will be found, I think, that there is a very direct relation between the certainty of news and the system of record. (Lippmann 1922, 342, 343).", "Wherever there is a good machinery of record, the modern news service works with great precision.

(Lippmann 1922, 342, 343).", "The regimentation and normalization of values and practices regulates journalistic behavior in the absence of any formal law or regulation establishing what or who should be covered, when, or how. For instance, Breed (1955) found that mid-twentieth-century publishers\u2019 content preferences were not directly imposed on reporters due to the taboo against interfering with their editorial autonomy. Instead, a new reporter \u201cdiscovers and internalizes the rights and obligations of his status and its norms and values. He learns to anticipate what is expected of him so as to win rewards and avoid punishments\u201d (328). Foucault (1982, 789) describes such a relationship of power, in which one acts based on anticipation rather than decree, as \u201ca mode of action which does not act directly and immediately on others. Instead, it acts upon their actions.\u201d In this study, I show how textbooks dating to 1894 have distilled and (re)constructed a contradictory journalistic ethos (see Mari 2015) that acts upon journalists\u2019 actions, until they are well-enough disciplined to restrain their own conduct despite their better judgment. Such restraints, while not formally curtailing journalists\u2019 freedom, nevertheless reproduce limits on what reporters and editors, and therefore many citizens, conceive as legitimate news."]}, {"sec_title": "Bourdieu and Journalistic Habitus", "sec_content": ["Foucaultian discipline is a helpful way to think about reporters\u2019 and editors\u2019 self-regulating tendencies, and the panopticon is a useful metaphor for conceiving one technology of power that prompts such self-regulating behavior. A complementary social theory illuminating the movement of power that helps shape journalistic decisions is Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s habitus. Foucault writes of the normalizing extra-legal forces that impose tables, movements, and exercises on the body, enacted through tactics. Bourdieu (1977) writes of \u201cthe collective enterprise of inculcation tending to produce habitus that are capable of generating practices regulated without express regulation or any institutionalized call to order\u201d (17). This habitus, like Foucault\u2019s discipline, seeks to foreground the backgrounded grooves of personal history, social custom and \u201ccommon sense\u201d that circumscribe the possibilities for action and response among members of particular groups. Habitus both structures actions and is continually structured by them; among other definitions, it is \u201cthe durably installed generative principle of regulated improvisations\u201d (1977, 78); it defines the boundaries in which a social actor is permitted to respond to events, and those responses help to reshape the boundaries. Cohen (1963) neatly illustrates this self-iterating set of practices by noting how foreign affairs reporters begin their days by scouring the previous day\u2019s news for clues as to how to proceed: \u201c[T]hus each of them is shaping both his news sense and his working day by examining the output of his professional colleagues, all of whom are simultaneously doing the same thing\u201d (58\u201359). Habitus, then, lies somewhere between structural determinism and human agency; individuals are free to act as they wish, but they are guided consciously by prescribed custom and subconsciously by doxa, \u201cthat which is taken for granted\u201d (Bourdieu 1977, 166)."]}, {"sec_title": "Textbooks", "sec_content": ["For this study, part of a larger research project on the discourse of textbook news values (Parks 2018), I read 75 reporting and writing textbooks published in the U.S. between 1894 and 2016 through the lens of Foucault\u2019s (1991; [1975] 1995) social theory of discipline, in collaboration with Bourdieu\u2019s (1977, 2005) habitus and fields. Although U.S. textbooks are products of a specific national culture, their influence extends well beyond American borders. For instance, such texts dominated journalism education in English-speaking African countries for half a century (De Beer 2010).", "There are many ways to conceive of discourse analysis. From a Foucaultian perspective, discourse represents the interaction of multiple domains of communication and practice that produce the environment in which certain things are possible to think and do (Fendler 2010). U.S. journalism textbooks \u2013 often voluminous pastiches of contemporary reporting, secondary literature, professional analysis, legal and ethical guidance, interviews, data, and offhand pontificating \u2013 provide one window into the broader, interconnected discourse of professional journalism (Vos 2012; Mari 2015) and help establish the habitus of journalistic practice. My concern in this study is to highlight examples of textbooks declaiming journalists\u2019 independence from government regulation and freedom to exercise news judgment according to their experience and conscience, as well as examples of the same texts insisting journalists must restrain their personal feelings, creative instincts, and individual judgment to conform to an ambiguously defined professional ethos and the ritual of \u201cobjectivity\u201d (Tuchman 1972; Mindich 1998).", "Texts were selected from a mix of sampling methods based on previous textbook studies touching multiple eras, using Mirando (1992)\u2019s exhaustive bibliography of pre-1990 texts and adapting Vos\u2019s (2012) procedure of sampling texts that published multiple editions. For post-1990 textbooks, I adopted Hopper and Huxford\u2019s (2017) list recommended by major publishers. I gathered available books from the composite list until reaching a satisfactory sample from across the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. I read each text thoroughly and took extensive analytical notes, which for this study meant critically interpreting assertions representing textbooks\u2019 explicit or implied positions on journalistic freedom, independence, and disciplinary obligations. Such notes included both paraphrases and direct quotations of relevant passages, plus a running analytical narrative coded with identifying labels such as \u201cdiscipline\u201d and \u201cautonomy.\u201d This process allowed me to return repeatedly to key data and to establish cumulative discursive patterns through the recurrent use of specific arguments, rationalizations, and metaphors across textbooks across time. The accumulated strata of professional discourse among books and eras, in a sense, places these authors in conversation with one another1 as collaborators in (re)constructing a discursive environment whose atmosphere pervades U.S. news decisions. I then compared these rhetorical and metaphorical patterns with Foucault\u2019s explication in rhetoric and metaphor of his concept of discipline as described across such social fields as the military, schools, hospitals, prisons, and factories. In the analysis below, I show significant links between Foucault\u2019s argument and the subjectivities constructed for journalists by the introductory textbooks that both interpret and help enculturate the journalistic field. These parallels help illuminate ways in which journalists act less freely than they could."]}, {"sec_title": "A Self-disciplining Field", "sec_content": ["Consistent with the literature cited above, U.S. journalism textbook authors from early in the twentieth century through the current era have been eager to assert the profession\u2019s autonomy, drawing from their own experience, legal history, studies of working journalists, and secondary literature to make their case. For instance, in discussing the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Yost (1924) points out that \u201cThe press is the only private institution that is so shielded by the mandate of that fundamental law\u201d (115\u2013116) and argues, \u201cThe very nature of this right makes any limitation of its exercise a paradox unless the limitation is in itself essential to the protection of society\u201d (116\u2013117). It is due to this special status, many authors argue later in the century, that journalists embrace autonomy as an entitlement. \u201cThe American newspaper is traditionally jealous of its independence,\u201d writes Charnley (1975, 133), adding that \u201c[t]he press, in effect, can do as it likes\u201d (142). The news media \u201chave absolute discretion to define news and the form in which it is presented,\u201d agree Hage et al. (1976, 26). Journalists resist licensing as \u201ca form of governmental control of the press\u201d (Harriss, Leiter, and Johnson 1981, 11). One textbook cites a study of Iowa daily newspapers that quotes a reporter boasting, \u201cWe\u2019re beholden to nobody\u201d (Mencher 1989, 40). Discourse from the current century echoes that of the previous one. Fedler et al. (2001, 556) write that \u201c[m]ost journalists resist guidelines that would limit their freedom to cover an important story.\u201d And Washington Post ombudsman Deborah Howell, quoted in Harrower (2010, 287), characterizes reporters and editors as \u201ca collection of scruffy, recalcitrant characters that\u2009\u2026\u2009don\u2019t like to be managed.\u201d Kershner (2009) reminds readers that this attitude flows from the fact that journalists are \u201clegally entitled to print almost anything\u201d (149).", "But textbooks across these decades have often led readers on a brief and precipitous journey from the celebration of autonomy to the imposition of common-sense disciplinary constraints. Yost (1924) above noted that ostensibly limitless journalistic freedom can be limited to protect society against some unarticulated risk \u2013 a formulation that encourages journalists to constantly check their output against the specter of social disapprobation. Yost tacks several disciplinary caveats to his original essentialist argument, subjecting press freedom to statutory law, plus: the law of custom, of reason and conscience, that society has in all times enacted for self-protection from liberty unrestrained.\u2009\u2026\u2009[I]t should never be forgotten that the right of free speech, however unlimited, is a sacred privilege that in itself confers an obligation to use it with decent moderation for the public purposes which alone can justify its maintenance. (Yost 1924, 117, 120)", "the law of custom, of reason and conscience, that society has in all times enacted for self-protection from liberty unrestrained.\u2009\u2026\u2009[I]t should never be forgotten that the right of free speech, however unlimited, is a sacred privilege that in itself confers an obligation to use it with decent moderation for the public purposes which alone can justify its maintenance. (Yost 1924, 117, 120)", "Textbooks from the first half of the twentieth century were quick to embrace restrictions on coverage of courts in particular. Many texts suggest that reporters can be punished for publishing commentary that could prejudice a jury or simply that \u201cholds the court up to ridicule or distrust in the public mind\u201d (Warren, 1929, 222\u2013223). In a later book, Warren (1959) adds that journalists dealing with libel and ethics issues confront a variety of \u201claws, written and unwritten, which limit the reporter for the purpose of ensuring and keeping the good will of the community\u201d (198). In the mid-twentieth century, Charnley (1959) concurred with these restrictions: \u201cThe press almost without exception recognizes as valid the principles behind the restrictive laws that make false or malicious libel punishable and that forbid indecent and obscene publication\u201d (15). In a later edition, Charnley offers an epigram from the Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in a 1974 interview with Walter Cronkite, juxtaposing the autonomy that permits journalists to do as they please with the discipline that prevents them: \u201cThe press must be totally free with respect to everything external to it. But internally it has to control its freedom\u201d (Charnley 1975, 9).", "Bond (1961) offers a parsimonious example of the ease with which textbooks transition from autonomy to discipline. Bond begins: \u201cA free press must be free from any compulsions, governmental or social.\u2009\u2026\u2009 Only public support can be accepted as a safe criterion\u201d (2). Almost immediately, Bond raises an exception for wartime, during which \u201cthis freedom does not protect the right to publish material that would undermine the public morale, encourage men to refuse to fight or give information to the enemy\u201d (3). This exception is followed with the assertion that, even in peacetime, \u201cthere are, of course, some freedoms which the press never had \u2013 the freedom, for example to be libelous or obscene\u201d (3) and the corollary that \u201cThe better journalists impose upon their work as they impose upon themselves the censorship of good taste\u201d (5). Note how willing and hasty is this retreat from total freedom, and how the acknowledgement that journalists \u201cimpose upon\u201d their own work echoes Foucault\u2019s description of the technologies of self-subjugation.", "As late as the 1980s, authors continued to demonstrate enthusiasm for any press limits they considered reasonable. \u201cIn America, the press is free and powerful, but its freedom and influence are not absolute,\u201d writes Metz (1977, 12\u201313). \u201cThey are properly curbed by laws on libel, obscenity, invasion of privacy, contempt of court and other matters. Indeed, press freedom is not an end in itself, but a means of guaranteeing that ideas deserving a public hearing will have a public hearing.\u201d Harriss, Leiter, and Johnson (1981) add: Every responsible editor knows that a newspaper simply cannot \u2013 and in a number of cases should not \u2013 print anything it wants to, even if the courts permitted. There are numerous reasons \u2013 social, economic, ethical \u2013 the First Amendment cannot be applied in its broadest, most literal sense to every story. (62)", "Every responsible editor knows that a newspaper simply cannot \u2013 and in a number of cases should not \u2013 print anything it wants to, even if the courts permitted. There are numerous reasons \u2013 social, economic, ethical \u2013 the First Amendment cannot be applied in its broadest, most literal sense to every story. (62)", "Mencher (1989) similarly suggests that, in the absence of sovereign state power to regulate press conduct, such responsibility falls on the shoulders of self-disciplining journalists: The founders of this country made sure that journalists would be free of government interference or supervision so that the press could be a check on power.\u2009\u2026\u2009Given such power, the press can be an unchecked power itself. If government has no control over the press, what then is to protect the public from a free-wheeling, irresponsible press?\u2009\u2026\u2009And this is precisely why codes and guidelines \u2013 whether they are written and handed to reporters along with a stylebook, or are the reporter\u2019s personal beliefs \u2013 are so important. (417)The philosophical contradictions described above generally address the autonomy and disciplinary responsibilities of the press as a collective field. Mencher\u2019s passage demonstrates how the field\u2019s implied disciplinary responsibilities filter to the individual journalist, whose \u201cpersonal beliefs\u201d are expected to comport with professional habitus. The following sections explore the technologies of discipline that regulate the conduct of individual reporters and editors, through textbook language and metaphor that are remarkably resonant from 1894 to the present day.", "The founders of this country made sure that journalists would be free of government interference or supervision so that the press could be a check on power.\u2009\u2026\u2009Given such power, the press can be an unchecked power itself. If government has no control over the press, what then is to protect the public from a free-wheeling, irresponsible press?\u2009\u2026\u2009And this is precisely why codes and guidelines \u2013 whether they are written and handed to reporters along with a stylebook, or are the reporter\u2019s personal beliefs \u2013 are so important.

But the sovereign authority of the city editor quickly gives way, even within these early texts, to metaphors that overlap Foucault\u2019s ([1975] 1995) discipline, which uses military hierarchy as a key exemplar. \u201cThe reporter is in some respects in the position of the soldier,\u201d writes Shuman (1894, 47). \u201c[H]e must carry out his chief\u2019s orders or die in the attempt.\u201d Likewise, the new reporter\u2019s \u201cduty is simply to do what he is told under the directions of a general in the person of the editor who directs the movements of the entire force\u201d (Hemstreet 1901, 46). For McCarthy (1906), \u201cDiscipline is as essential to the success of a newspaper as it is to that of the army\u201d (11\u201312).", "Foucault ([1975] 1995) describes the disciplining of soldiers as a \u201c\u2018\u2009\u2026\u2009micro-physics\u2019 of power\u201d (139) in which individuals are trained to self-regulate at the merest signal from a superior, their bodies rendered \u201cdocile,\u201d to be \u201csubjected, used, transformed and improved\u201d (136). It is in this spirit that \u201c[t]he discipline of the newspaper office, however hard it may be, teaches concentration of both eye and brain\u201d (Fowler 1913, 77), such that a reporter \u201chas served his apprenticeship when his mind can render a decision instinctively, requiring only a flash of thought\u201d (Byxbee 1901, 19). Such discipline places the interests of the newsroom above the individual: \u201cThe dailies grant each man his day off, but it is often intruded upon and the sense of responsibility is always with him\u201d (Seitz 1916, 68). In this way, the reporter, in parallel with Foucault\u2019s discipline, is regulated by time and timetables: In no other profession is timeliness such a constant factor or of such vast importance as in journalism\u2009\u2026\u2009.. City editors keep a schedule of assignments and the reporter\u2019s name is written opposite the assignment given to him. By consulting the schedule, the city editor may know how soon each reporter may be expected to return to the office and where and how he can communicate with him\u2009\u2026\u2009(Williams and Martin [1911] 1922, 162; 188).", "In no other profession is timeliness such a constant factor or of such vast importance as in journalism\u2009\u2026\u2009..

As Harwood (1927), anticipating Tuchman (1978), put it: \u201c[R]eporters never wander aimlessly around the streets, because the editorial offices have their sources of news so carefully watched and the activities of their staff so carefully systematized that little of a routine character ever escapes their vigilance\u201d (52). So deployed, the reporter \u201cis responsible for everything that happens in his territory, and seldom has to be told what to do\u201d (New York Times, 1941, 6), because a reporter worth his salary \u201cis so versed in what is expected of him that he can take initiative in the absence of the city editor and do exactly what should be done\u201d (Sheboygan, Wisconsin, City Editor Walter J. Pfister, quoted in Neal 1949, 39). Such disciplined behavior extends beyond the professional to the personal: Reporters are expected to \u201ckeep fit physically\u201d by avoiding long nights in bars and to \u201cbe mentally fit\u2009\u2026\u2009[They] can\u2019t be going off on a tantrum or tangent now and then\u201d (Wolseley and Campbell 1949, 89).", "The predictability of journalistic bodies evokes another Foucaultian site of discipline, the factory: an establishment where things are done in an organized, systematic manner, with considerable emphasis upon schedule or timetable. A factory is also an establishment where many, diverse, and intricate departments and divisions work together in cadence and in harmony.\u2009\u2026\u2009A newspaper is exactly that sort of establishment. (Neal 1949, 18)The discipline that governs this factory-like work, grounded in \u201c[s]ocial customs, history, geography, and economics,\u201d produces \u201cconditioning factors\u2009\u2026\u2009so well known to news workers, that two or twenty, or even two hundred, newsmen \u2013 given the same group of events from which to select \u2013 would make substantially the same decisions\u201d (Charnley 1959, 34). This description evokes Bourdieu\u2019s habitus, a distributed rule-following pattern that presents as common-sense even as its practitioners continue to make it up through \u201cregulated improvisations.\u201d As members of the broader journalistic field, reporters and editors across beats and news organizations share the sensibility that disciplines their daily work: \u201cThe general assignment reporter in a town of 25,000 and the AP\u2019s White House correspondent share a way of thinking, a set of techniques and an approach to journalism,\u201d writes Mencher (1991, x). \u201cReporters\u2009\u2026\u2009agree among themselves what constitutes news\u201d (57).", "an establishment where things are done in an organized, systematic manner, with considerable emphasis upon schedule or timetable. A factory is also an establishment where many, diverse, and intricate departments and divisions work together in cadence and in harmony.\u2009\u2026\u2009A newspaper is exactly that sort of establishment. (Neal 1949, 18)", "The sense of disciplined obligation expressed in textbooks in the early twentieth century persisted through that century and into the twenty-first. \u201c[T]he young journalist\u2009\u2026\u2009should be prepared to give all of himself to a demanding, exacting profession,\u201d writes Hohenberg ([1960] 1962, 5). \u201cIf not, he should get out of it at once.\u201d In a later edition, Hohenberg argues that reporters covering civil unrest must even \u201cexpose themselves to danger if necessary to determine the magnitude of any street incident\u201d (Hohenberg 1983, 290). Gibbs and Warhover (2002) echo the sentiment in the coverage of natural disasters. Harrower (2010, 90) summarizes the characteristics of the disciplined journalist: \u201c[Y]ou\u2019ve got to have moxie. Spunk. Guts. You\u2019ve gotta be pushy. Nervy. Ballsy.\u201d And Kolodzy (2013) quotes a reporter asserting, \u201cYou need to have the mentality that you\u2019re doing everything.\u2009\u2026\u2009The main thing is to learn that it\u2019s all necessary\u201d (13)."]}, {"sec_title": "Journalists Disciplining Journalists", "sec_content": ["The idea that well-disciplined reporters and editors tend to make similar decisions when confronted with the same set of facts and characters reflects the normalizing routines that render deviating activity a risk. The sense of looking over one\u2019s shoulder, evoking the technology of the panopticon, dates to the earliest texts. Shuman (1894, 49) remarks on \u201cthe enormous pressure and fear of failure under which every conscientious reporter works.\u201d Reporters are under constant fear of getting scooped, misspelling a name, leading with the wrong angle, not asking the tough question. Byxbee (1901), echoing Shuman, writes: \u201cThe great importance of a \u2018scoop\u2019 or a \u2018beat\u2019 should always be emphasized, and the disgrace of being \u2018scooped\u2019 never belittled\u201d (56). Benson (1937) writes, \u201cFailure to get the news is often almost entirely the fault of the reporter\u201d (65\u201366). To avert these derelictions, reporters watch one another like hawks, and they know they\u2019re being watched, thus playing dual panoptic roles as guardian and ward. Through much of the twentieth century, most news stories were published without bylines (see Ogan et al. 1975), meaning public acclaim or reprobation for individual reporters was rare. This led Ross (1911) to declare that \u201cThe average news writer, however brilliant his work, receives only the commendation of his fellows. It is for this he strives\u201d (20). Conforming with doxic common sense as to how to approach a given story helps reporters and editors defend their field\u2019s autonomy against external critique and motivates them to stay in step. Hence: The beat man works in close company with reporters from other newspapers. Seldom is it possible for one stationary beat man to obtain a story which the other beat men do not have. If the others do not happen to get the information at the same time, they overhear the reporter who does get it first phoning it to his office. They take notes as he talks and then phone their own offices. (MacDougall [1932] 1935, 65)Journalists\u2019 concern for the approval and support of their peers, sometimes to the detriment of broader interests, is similarly acknowledged later in the twentieth century. \u201cThere is\u2009\u2026\u2009a rather lamentable tendency among the Washington news corps to bid more for professional applause than public understanding\u201d (Hohenberg 1983, 392). Charnley (1975) suggests that if a journalist uses the proper standards to reach news decisions, \u201che is likely to earn his colleagues\u2019 approval and his community\u2019s respect\u201d (45).", "The beat man works in close company with reporters from other newspapers. Seldom is it possible for one stationary beat man to obtain a story which the other beat men do not have. If the others do not happen to get the information at the same time, they overhear the reporter who does get it first phoning it to his office. They take notes as he talks and then phone their own offices. (MacDougall [1932] 1935, 65)", "Of course, journalists are subject to the disciplinary gaze of many social actors in addition to their immediate peers. Both reporters and their editors make news decisions from within journalistic habitus and regulate their choices according to presumptions of what is expected of them. As Hage et al. (1976) note: \u201cReporters can\u2019t expect to function as independent entities, free to shape their own roles. They work, in varying degrees, under supervision and subject to pressure from colleagues and news sources\u201d (28). Reporters construct stories in anticipation of the expectations of fellow reporters, their supervising editors, their sources, and, particularly in the twenty-first century, their audiences. The newly realized audience, empowered through social media encounters and heightened newsroom attention to user metrics, exerts disciplinary authority in multiple dimensions, as Kolodzy (2013) notes. First, audiences influence how journalistic bodies are deployed: \u201cIf audiences multitask via Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, then today\u2019s journalists have to multitask there as well\u201d (5). And second, audiences exact new transparencies as they monitor reporters and editors\u2019 communication across boundaries: \u201cEven information posted on a personal Facebook page or using a personal Twitter account reflects back on the professional journalist and her news organization\u201d (74).", "All these additional sites of surveillance aside, even at the turn of the present century, U.S. textbooks suggest that journalists\u2019 primary disciplining authority is fellow journalists: \u201cThere is group pressure against the reporter who does not go along\u201d (Mencher 1991, 247), and \u201c[a]nyone involved with the mass media\u2009\u2026\u2009must understand the professional standards and demands that this culture imposes\u201d (Stovall 2002, 112). Gibbs and Warhover (2002) offer a telling quote from an American Journalism Review story: \u201cI think what we fear mostly is our colleagues.\u2009\u2026\u2009You don\u2019t want them to think that you\u2019re a slacker\u201d (386)."]}, {"sec_title": "Standards of Discipline", "sec_content": ["Foucault describes discipline in part as the deployment of patterns of behavior and response to expectations evoked by subtle stimuli. Importantly, the concept applies not just to the prison model of the panopticon but to numerous institutions that regulate individuals as aspects of multiplicities: factories and military units, as noted in textbook metaphors above; and also hospitals and schools. Early twentieth century U.S. textbooks called upon an emerging journalistic habitus of professional responsibility that arose with the formalization of journalism education. Ross (1911), for instance, quotes Joseph Pulitzer\u2019s manifesto for the school of journalism, whose language resembles the disciplinary rigor described by Foucault. Pulitzer argued that the reporter\u2019s instincts need development by teaching, by training, by practical object-lessons illustrating the good and the bad, the right and the wrong, the popular and the unpopular, the things that succeed and the things that fail, and above all the things that deserve to succeed, and the things that do not\u2009\u2026\u2009 (xii).These things that are and are not deserving are highlighted in Harrington and Frankenberg\u2019s (1912) quote from nineteenth century New York Sun editor Charles A. Dana\u2019s code for reporters. The original says: \u201cAbove all, know and believe that humanity is advancing; that there is progress in human life and human affairs; and that as sure as God lives, the future will be greater and better than the present or the past.\u201d An addendum says, \u201cHold fast to the Constitution.\u2009\u2026\u2009Stand by the Stars and Stripes. Above all, stand for Liberty, whatever happens\u201d (86).", "need development by teaching, by training, by practical object-lessons illustrating the good and the bad, the right and the wrong, the popular and the unpopular, the things that succeed and the things that fail, and above all the things that deserve to succeed, and the things that do not\u2009\u2026\u2009 (xii).", "Similarly, the Associated Press Managing Editors insist in a textbook passage that a good newspaper should be guided in the publication of all material by a concern for truth, the hallmark of freedom, by a concern for human decency and human betterment and a respect for the accepted standards of its own community (Rivers 1964, 336).But there is no guidance for the journalist working in a community whose accepted standards \u2013 say, the preservation of racial segregation \u2013 repudiate any concern for human decency. Which philosophy should prevail in such a paradox \u2013 the expressed human-elevating aims of the profession, or the discipline of the community that surveils the journalists\u2019 work? Burken\u2019s (1979) text suggests the latter, arguing, \u201cIt is not a profession for persons who view themselves as world-changers\u201d (2). And Hill and Breen (1977), borrowing from another knowledge field, favorably quote Henry Adams arguing, \u201cNo honest historian can take part with, or against \u2013 the forces that he has to study. To him even the extinction of the human race should be merely a fact to be grouped with other vital statistics\u201d (163).", "a good newspaper should be guided in the publication of all material by a concern for truth, the hallmark of freedom, by a concern for human decency and human betterment and a respect for the accepted standards of its own community (Rivers 1964, 336).", "One broadly held standard for U.S. journalists, indicated in Dana\u2019s prescription to \u201cStand by the Stars and Stripes,\u201d is the disciplining of journalists as patriots. \u201cCertain abstract principles are espoused by all American newspapers. Among them are justice, liberty, patriotism, the sanctity of the Constitution, equable taxes, honest government, sympathy for the weak and distressed, and community improvement\u201d (Mott 1958, 255). Bond (1961), as noted above, was careful to except content that \u201cwould undermine the public morale\u201d in wartime (3) from journalists\u2019 unfettered freedom. For Metz (1977), one of the functions of mass media is \u201cto spread and maintain our national culture\u201d (10) because \u201cjournalists are just as patriotic as everyone else\u201d (324).", "The journalist\u2019s duty toward patriotic enculturation, while occasionally challenged (e.g., Brooks et al. 2008), continues to surface in textbook commentary in the present century. Some journalism textbooks have sustained a narrative of unskeptical patriotism in their discussion of America\u2019s widely criticized twenty-first century wars. For instance, a broadcast expert\u2019s annotation of a TV news script about the body of a Marine being returned to his family notes, elegiacally, \u201cThis story is as old as storytelling, as old as war\u201d (Scanlan and Craig 2014, 321). The commentary emphasizes that the reporter is \u201csending a message\u201d when he ends a descriptive sequence by summarizing his subject solemnly as \u201cA Marine\u201d instead of closing with the Marine\u2019s young age of 20. Emphasizing the age, the commentator notes, \u201cmight have telegraphed the message \u2018what a waste of human life\u2019\u201d (322), which we are to infer is inappropriate. The annotation, then, privileges journalistic messages that glorify, rather than challenge, military deaths in war. Journalists who might be predisposed to alternative ways of framing such a story are subject to a discourse that disciplines them otherwise."]}, {"sec_title": "Conclusion", "sec_content": ["This study examines how U.S. journalism textbooks construct paradoxical subjectivities that imbue journalists with a sense of unfettered autonomy while simultaneously situating them in a habitus of tight, vague constraints. These constraints shape-shift through technologies of Foucaultian discipline in which journalists intuit their professional duties by watching one another and self-enforce their accepted obligations through anticipation of critique. The disciplining bent of the textbook language is clear in many of the quotations cited above, in which authors detail practices that journalists must and cannot undertake \u2013 imperatives that undermine declarations of journalistic autonomy.", "Journalistic discourse frequently encourages reporters to regulate their decisions and behaviors based not on the law or specific written policy, but rather on their often unarticulated anticipation of how any particular decision will go over \u2013 with senior managers, with front-line editors, with their peers, and, more today than in the past, with interactive audiences (Anderson 2013). Textbook author Charnley (1959) succinctly captures the essence of Foucaultian discipline in narrowing a reporter\u2019s freedom of observation: \u201cHe has to see things as he thinks almost everybody else would see them\u201d (248).", "A key feature of this discourse is the paradox between how journalists are invited to perceive themselves vs. how they are disciplined to behave. Generally, textbooks suggest that journalists are watchdogs and reformers whose work improves social conditions by bringing injustice to light. But journalists are called upon to undertake this endeavor without the explicit intent to do so, and without engaging emotionally in their attempts. Other disciplines that frequently confront conflict and trauma \u2013 medicine, law enforcement, the military \u2013 experience some parallels in the juxtaposition of detachment and engagement expected of their practitioners. Foucault ([1975] 1995) applies his theory of discipline across such fields, whose actors subject their bodies and behavior to the kinds of regulatory regimes described above. But journalists are unique in their disciplinary proscription against intervening. Soldiers and police are trained to separate good guys from bad guys and treat each accordingly; doctors are trained to heal, firefighters to put out fires. Only journalists are trained to stand apart from unfolding disaster and simultaneously expected to display some vaguely defined nonpartisan compassion.", "This paradox in which journalists tether internal disciplinary responsibilities to their strategically asserted autonomy from external fields serves both as a bulwark against formal censorship and as a barrier to practical risk-taking. It helps protect against interference by ensuring the press monitors its own ideological behavior. But, most fundamentally, it produces artificial limits to journalists\u2019 judgment and imagination, penning them into practices that ultimately undermine their responsibility to public service and render them vulnerable to manipulators who leverage disciplinary norms to achieve self-serving ends.", "The power of these disciplinary limits renders all the more remarkable the heterodox journalists I invoked at the beginning of this paper, who in significant moments kept their own counsel on the tone and timing of news. U.S. journalism textbooks often celebrate such individuals while urging reporters to suppress the very instincts that made them great. Harrower (2010), for instance, offers an appendix of stories by iconic writers, extolling their idiosyncrasies without acknowledging the irony that he discourages these same practices throughout the body of his book.", "It is not entirely clear why textbook authors don\u2019t directly confront the paradoxical nature of their contradictory imperatives. The authors, like their cited sources and intended audiences, are immersed in a professional discourse entangled with the same habitus that their texts (re)produce. Through the decades they have looked to the leaders and products of their field, and to one another, for signals delineating the rhetorical and symbolic capital embedded in journalistic autonomy and the social and practical boundaries of autonomous practice. Institutional journalism education has long been perceived as an ally and defender of the commercial press rather than a critical reformer (Sloan 1990), so it is reasonable to expect that the contradictions of a profit-driven news ecosystem would manifest in its educational texts. Textbook authors Brooks et al. (2008) offer a rare critical take to this effect: While American journalism may seem superficially to be liberal, at a deeper level it is profoundly conservative. Think of the foundation stones on which the American way of life is based. Among them are capitalism, the two-party system, the myths of the ethnic melting pot and of social mobility. When was the last time you saw any of those questioned seriously in the mainstream press? (Brooks et al. 2008, 14).A key goal of this study\u2019s illumination of the contradictions in U.S. journalism textbooks is to foster explicit discussion about the taken-for-granted assumptions of journalistic discourse and to reconsider the value choices embedded in daily decisions (see also Parks 2017). One great gift of Foucault\u2019s work is his insight that, as self-enforcers of the disciplinary constraints we enact each day, we are free at any time to walk off the job \u2013 to stop policing ourselves as we believe others would police us (Fendler 2010). Many of the greatest journalists intuit this camouflaged freedom (see Ryfe 2006), and bring it into the open.", "While American journalism may seem superficially to be liberal, at a deeper level it is profoundly conservative.
