Innovation in data and computational journalism serves as the study\u2019s case example. The roles played by ancillary organizations within a changing, complex journalism space are increasingly important, and understudied. Both field and ecology approaches describe ancillary organizations as agents of innovation, but they explain the dynamics differently. Field approaches assume ancillary organizations \u201cconsecrate\u201d innovations, and that innovations result from oppositional stances to established practices. Ecology approaches assume ancillary organizations foster interaction, which leads to shared ideas about innovation. The study is based on interviews with various agents in the data journalism space, including working data journalists and ancillary organization leaders. Findings suggest both field and ecology theories are helpful in explaining the innovation process. Field theory is especially helpful for explaining the structural contexts and strategy of innovation, while ecology approaches take a more organic approach, shedding light on the role of human interaction in the adaptation, change and growth of innovation.", "body": [{"title": "", "paragraphs": ["Research on media innovation commonly focuses on the nature of the innovation and the decisions of adopting agents, and is often informed by models of innovation adoption and acceptance (e.g., Rogers 2003; Venkatesh et al. 2003). In this research, it is assumed innovations and their spread are guided mostly by rational-choice, cost\u2013benefit analysis, and social contexts are often secondary.1 In the current study, we compare two \u201cmeso-level spatial\u201d approaches \u2013 field theory and ecology theory \u2013 which, we argue, more fully accommodate the complex structural contexts and \u201cboundedly rational\u201d decisions people make about the production of media innovation.", "The contexts and agencies behind these decisions are increasingly complicated and pluralistic, as the economic and cultural clout of commercial news companies slips, and as journalism\u2019s struggles warrant ongoing innovation (e.g., Benson 2018). The rise of foundation support for journalism R&D, education and associations over the last decade is evidence of this trend (Nisbet et al. 2018), but so is the growing number and diversity of professional associations, training centers and media tech labs (Media Labs 2018). An advantage of using meso-level spaces for social analysis is that they map and explain the complex relationships among a social space\u2019s many manifest and latent agents and contexts. Analyses show that the bounded, collective sense-making of these agents can lead to change, but it can also reproduce the way things are normally done within the space, maintaining boundaries and stability (Fligstein and McAdam 2012; Liu and Emirbayer 2016).", "One important and often overlooked agent is the understudied \u201cancillary organization.\u201d Ancillary organizations include professional membership associations, trade groups, professional training centers, labs, foundations and academic programs. In the journalism space analyzed in this study, which is situated in the West with a U.S. focus, examples include the Online News Association, WAN-IFRA, the European Journalism Centre, Google News Labs, the Knight Foundation, and schools of journalism.2 Ancillary organizations act offstage (or at least not central stage) in the performance of media production. However, as field and ecology approaches show, they play critical roles in the processes by which new things gain perceived value, legitimation and resource support.", "A field-ecology theoretical comparison is broad, so we have narrowed our analysis to innovation in data and computational journalism \u2013 hereafter, \u201cdata journalism.\u201d Data journalism lends itself to a meso-level analysis: It is a vibrant and variable but bounded domain with a budding internal logic. Data journalism is experiencing ongoing innovation across multiple areas, including information gathering, coding, archiving, and presentation, and numerous active and supportive ancillary organizations play a role in the governance of control and change within the social space. The data journalism space also negotiates borders with other adjacent spaces such as computer science, academic research, government offices and foundations. Field and ecology approaches are both useful for explaining social spaces such as these \u2013 spaces with internal logics, internal diversity of agents, and complex environments.", "The concepts of innovation and change in this study overlap but are not interchangeable. We adopt Hage\u2019s (1999) organization-centric definitions: Innovation is \u201cadoption of an idea or behavior that is new to an organization\u201d and also refers to a general dynamic (i.e. a rate) rather than a singular idea or behavior (599\u2013600). Change refers to mutability in the context of innovation (the environment or the organization), and so change may prepare the way for, or discourage, innovation.", "In sum, this study explores the roles that ancillary organizations play in the emergence and growth of data journalism innovation, from the perspectives of field and ecology theories \u2013 specifically, the often-used field theory of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu and ecology theory of the American Chicago School of Sociology \u2013 and compares the relative usefulness of these approaches in explaining innovation and its social contexts. Below, we first explain and compare fields and ecologies as social spaces within a journalism context. We next discuss the varied roles that ancillary organizations play in encouraging and discouraging change and innovation in these spaces. Finally, we present and discuss findings from a comparative field/ecology analysis of the role of ancillary organizations in data journalism change and innovation. Findings derive from 24 in-depth interviews with data journalists and with directors/staff of journalism ancillary organizations."]}, {"title": "Meso-Level Spatial Approaches: Fields and Ecologies", "paragraphs": ["Recent writings in the sociology of media (Benson 2014; Lowrey 2018; Ryfe 2017; Shoemaker and Vos 2009) and in sociology more broadly (Fligstein and McAdam 2012; Liu and Emirbayer 2016; Martin 2003; Mohr 2005) have observed the spread of \u201cspatial\u201d theoretical approaches positioned at the meso-level. Generally, meso-level spaces sit between the micro level of individual agency and the macro level of political and economic institutions.3 Applied to media production studies, these approaches help us understand relationships among media producers and other agents within the wider contexts of government and markets (Ryfe 2017). Meso-level spatial approaches accommodate both agency and structure, as well as social change and social control. They allow for both change and stability through complex, collective human interaction (e.g., between media producers and other agents), which takes place within somewhat autonomous and bounded social spaces.", "Fields and ecologies have been the dominant meso-level spatial models in journalism research (e.g., Benson 2013, 2014; Boyles 2017; English 2016; Hartley 2015),4 and there are similarities and differences in the ways they explain change, innovation and stasis. Both approaches assume a journalistic social space that has mutable boundaries and an internal governing logic. Agents in the space have some autonomy in their decisions, but decisions are also channeled by the space\u2019s well-worn, naturalized (and human-generated) routines or conventions. Decisions are not merely rational choices based on optimizing, cost/benefit analysis. Rather, decisions can emerge from shared, taken-for-granted agreements about the ways things have been done, historically or conventionally. Agency and structure are influenced by higher-order phenomena such as market forces and government power.", "While ecologies and fields have similarities, there are paradigmatic differences. Bourdieu\u2019s field approach (e.g., 1993, 1996) is grounded in a European neo-Marxist tradition, and emphasizes institutional power, capital, conflict and opposition. Chicago School ecology derives from an optimistic, pragmatist American perspective that emphasizes a world \u201cstill in the making\u201d (James [1907] 1979), a social space experiencing ongoing change through human interaction and actual use, within a system that is organic and adaptive (Abbott 2005a). Social ecology approaches have structural functionalist underpinnings \u2013 systems adapt to change in order to continue functioning as they have been (Liu and Emirbayer 2016). However, the interactionist/pragmatist Chicago School approach allows for fluid unpredictability. Bourdieu ([1971] 1987, 126) was no fan of interactionism, calling it \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and believing it flawed for ignoring the \u201cobjective structure of\u2009. . .\u2009relations.\u201d Chicago School scholars have criticized Bourdieu\u2019s theory as unrealistic for overlooking the unpredictability born of human interaction (Abbott 2005b; Becker 2008).", "The aspects of field and ecology approaches that are most relevant to innovation, change and stasis are discussed briefly below.", "Bourdieu\u2019s version of field theory5 debuted to the journalism studies field over a decade ago (e.g., Benson and Neveu 2005), and the approach has since gained traction in research on journalistic change (e.g., English 2016; Hartley 2015; Stevenson 2016; Ryfe 2017; Tandoc and Jenkins 2015). Actors (individuals, organizations) operate within a field, a meso-level space with mutable boundaries. Actors exercise variable autonomy. Their choices are strongly influenced by a field of political-economic power but also guided by their own field\u2019s internal governing logic, or nomos. Actors are socialized over time to this logic, developing a kind of muscle memory that knows \u201chow the game is played\u201d in the field, which Bourdieu calls habitus. This socialization tends to support the status quo (Bourdieu\u2019s approach has been criticized for inattention to historical change [e.g., Born 2015]); however, a field\u2019s governing logic can also coordinate response to external disruption, and so encourage and affect change and innovation in the field.", "The distribution of capital across the field is shaped by political-economic power, and it influences patterns of change and stasis across the field, which in turn shape opportunities for innovation. Capital takes different forms, including economic capital, cultural capital (cultural competency, or ingrained understanding of proper ways to behave in a field), symbolic capital (status, acclaim, honor) and social capital (Bourdieu 1984; Johnson 1993). Actors stake out various positions within the field in opposition to what already exists, and so innovation is typically a product of conflict. Actors \u201cmark difference\u201d with traditional ways of doing journalism: They may propose new purposes for journalism, start a new news outlet, or generate a new kind of story form. The avant garde pushes out the old guard (Bourdieu 1993; Johnson 1993).", "Such innovative position-takings result from emergent opportunities in the field\u2019s space of possibles (Bourdieu 1993, 176). Availability of capital (influenced by political-economic power) makes certain positions in the field alluring and sustainable, as does the conversion of one form of capital into another. For example, Powers and Vera-Zambrano (2016) found that journalists\u2019 success in creating online news startups was aided by their advantageous positioning within the field due to their cultural and symbolic capital (legitimacy and status) and the ability to convert this non-economic capital into startup funds.", "The social ecology approach adopted here derives from the first Chicago School in the U.S., and dates back to research by Robert Park and colleagues on urban ecology, newspapers and rational discourse (e.g., Park, Burgess, and McKenzie [1915] 1967). A unique aspect of Chicago School social ecology is the inclusion of the pragmatic symbolic interactionism of George Herbert Mead ([1934] 2015) and Herbert Blumer (1969), which threads through the research (and which was influenced by sociologist Georg Simmel). Traditionally, ecological perspectives, with their natural science roots, have been grounded in functionalist assumptions, which tend to discourage change in the system. However, the introduction of symbolic interactionism provides a micro-level unpredictability that affords change. For Park, social structures were \u201cinfluenced by the definition of the situation and meanings attributed to places and institutions by individuals\u201d (Reitzes 2017, 50). From an interactionist perspective, social space is shaped and reshaped at the micro-level. People adapt by working things out, moment to moment, in ongoing interaction, creatively anticipating and \u201cmutually indicating\u201d to one another (Blumer 1969). Adaptation for survival is a driving force, and adaptation leads to surprising new contexts for further (ongoing) interaction and adaptation. Ecological approaches offer an organic, human-level explanation for social change that is not as evident in Bourdieu\u2019s structured, power-laden field (Liu and Emirbayer 2016).", "The formal use of ecologies has been less common than the use of fields in recent studies of journalistic change, although ecological concepts \u2013 ecosystem, niche, adaptation \u2013 pervade this literature. Sociologist Andrew Abbott\u2019s (1988) ecological System of Professions approach has been used and cited with some frequency. In Abbott\u2019s approach, professions compete with one another for control over areas of work, or \u201cjurisdictional\u201d niches, within a wider ecosystem. Interactions are fluid and unpredictable, and not necessarily functional. Level of \u201cabstract knowledge\u201d affects the ability to change in the social space. Professionals within a social space share abstract knowledge so they may confer and ideate, and possibly redefine their space in order to adapt to pressures from the outside. For example, Blankenship (2016) found that when \u201cmobile\u201d TV journalists were threatened by time pressures, they repositioned their boundaries and claims of jurisdictional authority around their ability to control both video production and reporting. Similarly, Lowrey and Mackay (2008) found that journalists who were aware of local blogging rivals tended to redefine blogs as information sources, co-opting them as reporting tools. A second ecology approach with Chicago School roots, organizational ecology or population ecology (Carroll and Hannan 2000; Hannan and Freeman 1989), has also been used to study journalistic change (Dimmick 2003; Lowrey 2012; Monge and Poole 2008). In this approach, organizations adopt forms and practices that are similar to one another, as they seek security, legitimacy and similar resources within common niches. Interaction fosters adaptation and encourages mimicry (isomorphism), leading to development of populations, or collections of similar kinds of organizations. Using an organizational ecology approach to study social networking sites, Weber, Fulk, and Monge (2016) found that \u201ccommunicating with peers\u201d (311) about ongoing site iterations contributed to common forms, and to the development of a population and sub-niches.", "Both field and ecology approaches include bounded meso-level spaces with internal logics that experience ongoing challenges to autonomy. Both assume these spaces include multiple, diverse actors interacting in complex ways, and that behavior may be shaped by factors other than cost/benefit analysis \u2013 for example, routines, conventions and pursuit of legitimacy.", "Below are key differences between field and ecology approaches in the ways they explain change and innovation in the field: Political-economic power plays a more overt, consequential role in field theory than in ecology theory, affording certain possibilities for innovation in a \u201cspace of possibles.\u201d Bourdieu views his topography of relationships among actors as \u201cobjective\u201d but as shaped by constant struggle. In ecology theory, the state and market are important, but relative advantages in the space are not pre-mapped by power and capital. A social collective like a profession may use \u201cabstract knowledge\u201d to re-imagine social reality, adjusting goals and criteria for success, often leading to unexpected outcomes.Field theory assumes a tendency toward social control (power, constraint, stability), and the challenging theoretical task is to explain social change. Ecology theory assumes a tendency toward social change, and the challenging task is to explain social control.Field theory is fundamentally agonistic, or conflict-oriented. Innovations result from entities taking positions to oppose objective situations, and from their seeking and accumulating \u201ccapital\u201d to support their positions. Ecology theory emphasizes competition, but the emphasis is on ongoing adaptation to unpredictable situations and resources rather than on winning or losing.In field theory, innovation is aided by accessibility to capital across a field and a sanctioning of new forms, often from the field of power. In ecology theory, when an innovation successfully adapts to shifting resources, interaction about this tends to encourage mimicry and modeling, growing legitimacy and resources organically.", "Political-economic power plays a more overt, consequential role in field theory than in ecology theory, affording certain possibilities for innovation in a \u201cspace of possibles.\u201d Bourdieu views his topography of relationships among actors as \u201cobjective\u201d but as shaped by constant struggle.

These roles are fleshed out, below.", "Meso-level spatial approaches accommodate multiple agents and assume complex interactions. Investigation of these complex, diverse interactions can bring latent, but important, agents to light. Ancillary organizations are just such an agent. In journalism, ancillary organizations such as professional associations (e.g., Society for Professional Journalists, WAN-IFRA), training centers (e.g., European Journalism Centre, Poynter), foundations that support journalism (e.g., Knight, McCormick) and schools of journalism play important roles in the production of meaning about new things and new ideas, both within and outside the social space. Certainly, they are involved in the ongoing development and innovation of data journalism practices and principles. However, the ways ancillary organizations enact these roles differ between field and ecology approaches.", "Within Bourdieu\u2019s fields, ancillary organizations are consecrators of new things and ideas. Bourdieu examined the role of ancillary entities6 in the study of the field of artistic/literary culture, specifically, the \u201ccritics, publishers, gallery directors and the whole set of agents whose combined efforts produce consumers capable of knowing and recognizing the work of art as such\u201d (Bourdieu 1993, 37). Field theory emphasizes the \u201cobjective relations between producers and different agents of legitimation, specific institutions such as academies, museums, learned societies, and the educational system [and] these authorities consecrate a certain type of work\u201d (Bourdieu 1993, 121). In field theory, ancillary organizations help establish the social existence and meanings of new positions taken within the field \u2013 i.e., innovations. These organizations are the decoders and ciphers, even the high priests, of the meanings of the field\u2019s objective relationships, which define the meaning of innovations.", "In ecology approaches, ancillary organizations encourage innovation in a different way. They support the processes of symbolic interaction that shape the emergence, meaning and legitimation of innovation, rather than divine and consecrate it. The emergence of innovation and ecosystem adaptation to it is \u201ca highly social process, and\u2009\u2026\u2009intermediary [i.e. ancillary] organizations are critical\u201d (Rekers 2016, 1059). Ancillary organizations are conveners that aid the processes by which new things emerge and develop meanings, find their places within the wider ecosystem, and then spread, often through mimicry. Through conferences, workshops, and online forums and publications, ancillary organizations facilitate communication among innovators and potential adopters, suppliers, professional associations, schools of journalism, and others. This facilitation reduces uncertainty about the processes and meanings of new ideas, encourages adaptation to them (Aldrich and Ruef 2007; Howells 2006), and fosters the development of common, legitimated forms of innovation (Grabher, Ibert, and Flohr 2008; Greenwood, Hinings, and Suddaby 2002)."]}, {"title": "Research Questions", "paragraphs": ["The following questions ask about change and innovation in data journalism and the context of the wider journalism space; about the role of ancillary organizations within this space; and how well field and ecology theories explain the emergence, development and persistence of change and innovation in data journalism.

While some argue that data journalism offers a way to bypass third-party government sources, government offices are still vital sources for data journalism (Lowrey and Hou 2018). Yet, data journalist respondents rarely questioned government\u2019s authority over data set and data category construction, as long as data appear recent and thorough, as this comment suggests: I don\u2019t have to justify that we\u2019re using the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the jobs report. It\u2019s a matter of making sure on our end that we\u2019re reporting stuff accurately.Findings suggest that in seeking and using government datasets, data journalists may question government agency motives, but this conflict is perceived as normal rather than deviant \u2013 evidence of journalists\u2019 habitus. \u201cData journalists are used to it,\u201d as one said.", "I don\u2019t have to justify that we\u2019re using the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the jobs report. It\u2019s a matter of making sure on our end that we\u2019re reporting stuff accurately.", "According to respondents, innovation in data journalism tends to emerge from the later stages of the data journalism process, such as data processing and the graphical \u201cvisualization\u201d of data. In field theory terms, these tasks fall within a space of possibles, safe within journalism boundaries and at a distance from government power. In contrast to data collection, these tasks seem unlikely to cross government authority.", "Respondents indicated that foundations and tech companies are increasingly important influences on the data journalism space. Several respondents from professional associations and training centers expressed concern that, as one association director said, \u201ca lot of newsrooms have a limited budget, and have to be selective\u201d in their professional involvement. The traditional revenue streams of membership dues and conference fees have dwindled, and respondents mentioned the importance of foundation support in compensating, though these responses varied by organizational resources and priorities. Respondents said foundation support was important to their core missions: Foundations \u201cplay a very large role\u2009\u2026\u2009hundreds of thousands of dollars in a given year,\u201d they are \u201cvery important\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019d like to expand [foundation support].\u201d Several respondents also mentioned financial support from tech companies, which generally encourage data journalism. Per field theory, redistributed capital opens new spaces for innovational position-taking, and these innovations will likely reflect the needs of the powerful foundations and tech companies providing the capital.", "The few foundations oriented toward journalism, the Knight Foundation prominent among them, sit adjacent to, or intersect, the meso-level journalism space. The impact of Knight on innovation, with its emphasis on disruptive digital information technologies, was mentioned by respondents and has been noted in previous scholarship (Lewis 2011). However, one foundation representative said journalism receives only modest attention from most large foundations, which perceive journalism as a tool for accomplishing broader missions. The former head of one large foundation\u2019s journalism program said the foundation supported data journalism because it fits with the foundation\u2019s support of open data in the civic political realm. They wanted \u201cto leverage more investments around [data]\u2009. . .\u2009and the civic tech innovators were already there.\u201d According to the foundation officer, political entities increasingly support open-data/open-source platforms for use by citizens because these offer ways to bypass journalistic control over political messages \u2013 evidence of political power challenging the journalism field\u2019s weak autonomy.", "Data journalist respondents positioned themselves at a distance from foundation support because of \u201cissues with objectivity.\u201d They tended to value the cultural capital of the journalism space over foundation capital. According to one data journalist, \u201cYou have to be careful [about] stipulations that a particular program or agency might have on giving you money to do a data project.\u201d", "Though recent evidence suggests news executives are receptive to foundation capital (Nisbet et al. 2018), traditional news organizations find change difficult. Decisions are channeled by the routine contours of the field and the economic and cultural capital that has collected there. One professional association director noted: So much of [traditional news organization] revenue is tied to this old problematic way of doing things, and you can't just walk away from all that revenue. So, they end up having to maintain the thing that isn't working.Schools of journalism, often considered incubators of new ideas, may also follow entrenched paths shaped by the news industry\u2019s traditional distribution of capital. A professional association director said schools are not \u201ctearing up the journalism world with innovation\u201d because schools want current graduates to be employable now, \u201cand journalism companies need people who can do things the traditional way.\u201d", "So much of [traditional news organization] revenue is tied to this old problematic way of doing things, and you can't just walk away from all that revenue. So, they end up having to maintain the thing that isn't working.", "The second research question asks what role ancillary organizations play in data journalism innovation, and how these roles reflect field and ecological perspectives. Respondents mentioned the top U.S. professional membership association that specializes in data journalism as especially influential in shaping data journalism. Data journalist respondents generally said their news outlets supported their attendance at this organization\u2019s events, an example of niche development in journalism.", "Consistent with ecological approaches, interview respondents at generalized, non-niche ancillary organizations described changes among ancillary organizations as adaptive rather than oppositional. Some ancillary organizations have reshaped fundamental goals and purposes. Two older training centers have drawn back from training efforts in emerging technical areas like data/computational journalism, and both are increasingly identified with their online publications about the news industry. One older generalist professional association has scaled back on cutting-edge training, and increasingly plays a support role in helping smaller, specialized ancillary organizations with event operations.", "Professional associations and training centers generally acknowledged increased \u201ccompetition for the same pool of resources,\u201d as one assistant director said, due to diminishing news company support, but they also emphasized collaboration to achieve goals. From a field theory perspective, generalized organizations are an \u201cold guard\u201d against which newer, specialized organizations are defining themselves. Yet, field theory is less helpful for explaining the diverse survival efforts pursued by older, generalist organizations, as they use their collective abstract knowledge to redefine goals, boundaries and practices, sometimes competitively and sometimes collaboratively.", "From an ecology perspective, ancillary organizations help legitimate innovation and aid adaptation of innovations with the wider ecosystem by fostering interaction (Aldrich and Ruef 2007; Rekers 2016). Respondents from professional associations and training centers tended to portray data journalism innovation as a consequence of interactive collaboration, involving journalists from diverse areas in discussion with experts within and outside of journalism. These organizations \u201cconnect journalists with new ideas\u201d and foster shared practices, as one training center director said. A professional association director saw his organization \u201cmostly as conveners for those innovative ideas to propel the conversation.\u201d The director also emphasized a pragmatist approach, encouraging innovation in data journalism through interactive hands-on conference sessions rather than teaching objective guidelines: There\u2019s an audience at a conference that doesn't just want to hear that you have a really cool project. They want to know how you go about tackling common challenges, so that when they go back to work, they can apply the same thing.Data journalist respondents also discussed the importance of creating through collaboration: Data journalism has really benefitted in the last few years from the arrival of quantitative political science types and computer science types\u2009. . .\u2009who have different perspectives and skill sets, and that has sort of created a ferment of methods and\u2009. . .\u2009collaborations.Data journalists were also likely to emphasize internal collaboration, within the \u201ccommunity of data journalists,\u201d as one said. According to another: \u201cFor our little corner of the profession, conferences and workshops have been essential\u2009\u2026\u2009[and] the fact that we feed off each other is a really important part of how this has been shaped.\u201d", "There\u2019s an audience at a conference that doesn't just want to hear that you have a really cool project.

New practices selected from the pool of variations may spread through interaction and legitimation. This process may take the form of rational-choice modeling (Aldrich and Ruef 2007), or less-than-rational mimicry and faddishness (Hannan and Freeman 1989). Some ancillary organization respondents provided examples of processes that encourage rational-choice modeling about data journalism at conference and workshop sessions. One professional association associate director said his organization tries \u201cto encourage conversations at conferences that [take the form of]: \u2018I had a challenge. I overcame a challenge, and here\u2019s how I went about it.\u2019\u201d", "Ancillary organization respondents acknowledged less-than-rational mimicry within the space. Innovation is \u201cnot as systematic as it might seem,\u201d said a training center director. Innovation may be pursued, according to one training center director, because people think \u201cthere\u2019s really cool stuff happening here.\u201d Mimicry can lead to more of the same because of mindless \u201cfads and cascades,\u201d as the director of a data journalism lab put it. According to a professional association director, \u201cSo much of modern journalism today is just like the flavor of the moment or repeating something that somebody else has already done, with a new take.\u201d", "Data journalist respondents acknowledged mimicry, but as beneficiaries of the mimicry, they were uncritical, portraying it as convenient and expected: \u201cEverybody just watches what everybody else is doing\u201d and \u201cWhenever I go to one of these conferences, I\u2019m looking for like, \u2018Here are some things that I can cookbook\u2019.\u201d Another data journalist said the flashy \u201ccool\u201d factor of new technology is powerful: \u201c[In workshop sessions] we can all sit in a room together and have this collective \u2018whoa! that\u2019s super impressive\u2019 moment.\u201d", "Data journalists mentioned top legacy news outlets and national digital-first news outlets as inspirations for modeling/mimicry \u2013 \u201csome of these hundred-years-plus organizations are being so creative,\u201d as a training center instructor said. However, respondents viewed the top professional association for data journalism as particularly important. Respondents said their news organizations \u201csend people\u201d to this professional association\u2019s events or \u201cbring people in\u201d from this organization \u201cevery year\u201d or on a consistent basis. News organizations were described as \u201call in,\u201d \u201csuper invested\u201d and \u201cinvested in the culture\u201d of data journalism. The director of this association discussed efforts to generate a common set of principles and practices for data journalism: We\u2019ve published books, we have thousands of tips sheets in our library, and we have data that we customize for newsrooms\u2009. . .\u2009and the awards program is working.", "We\u2019ve published books, we have thousands of tips sheets in our library, and we have data that we customize for newsrooms\u2009. . .\u2009and the awards program is working.", "Respondents from ancillary organizations commonly made \u201cconsecrating\u201d comments that supported data journalism\u2019s position within the field. They did this by arguing for data\u2019s unique claims on objectivity, transparency and authenticity \u2013 all qualities needed by an ailing news industry facing a credibility deficit and accusations of \u201cfake news.\u201d A foundation officer referenced research on data journalism showing younger audiences were likely to perceive numerical charts as fact: \u201c[They] buy into data, and they are really hungry for [and] calling for the truth, and data is a key component of building that trust.\u201d The director of a data journalism program at a university said data analysis has a pure authenticity that traditional reporting lacks: [Data journalism] is not a third party. It's not a source. It's not a document.

One data journalist described data journalism as \u201ca small priesthood\u201d in which, at conferences, \u201cwe know each other\u2019s work and we kind of all talk the same language, and then we\u2019re sort of evangelists when we go back to our home newsrooms.\u201d According to another: \u201cWe\u2019re kind of like our own little family of disciples and we\u2019re trying to continue to spread the gospel of data journalism.\u201d According to one training center director: These are educators and evangelists who spread the word of investigative and data journalism around the world.

From an ecology perspective, data journalism is a growing, interactive, fluid community, adaptive to the wider ecosystem rather than oppositional.", "Findings here may not be generalized to the entire data journalism space, but they do suggest field theory may be most helpful for mapping the structure of the space and the factors shaping that structure, thereby explaining what\u2019s likely and what\u2019s not likely. Interviews indicate that shifting institutional support is altering the field\u2019s topography and the \u201cspace of possibles\u201d for innovation (Bourdieu 1993) Several ancillary organization respondents mentioned the demise of news company support for professional development, weakening support for generalist ancillary organizations that have traditionally sanctioned existing practices. They also noted growth in support for specialist organizations, such as those supporting data journalism. Capital from foundations and tech companies pools in alternative spaces, providing support for new practices and forms, including data journalism. Many foundations focus on wider issues of democratic governance (and not narrowly on journalism) for which investigative hard news is perceived as important, an emphasis consistent with data journalism. Development of data journalism tools also fits with the mission and profit interests of tech companies. There is evidence that the power of government institutions affects data journalism changes in latent ways: Interview responses indicated data journalists are unlikely to question government agencies about the structure of categories and data sets, and innovation is more likely to emerge in the areas of data sharing and data presentation \u2013 practices that do not encroach directly into the field of government.", "Consistent with field theory\u2019s agonism (Johnson 1993), findings show data journalists taking oppositional positions to a weakened \u201cold guard\u201d journalism that has historically privileged narrative accounts and official voices over quantitative accounts. Findings suggest this difference with traditional journalism strengthens data journalists\u2019 collective identity, aiding their ability to organize, to access the capital that is collecting in recently widening spaces, and to maintain their new position. Further, respondents suggested ancillary organizations help consecrate and legitimate these new positions (Bourdieu 1993) \u2013 for example, by portraying data-driven accounts as more objective, transparent and authentic than narrative \u201cthird-party\u201d accounts.", "However, this portrayal is incomplete. Interview responses reveal a more complicated situation involving the collaboration and adaptation found in ecology approaches. While field theory indicates structured probabilities of winning and losing in a system shaped by both persistent practices and opposition to them, ecology theory indicates surprising possibilities for survival, adaptation and proliferation within a fluid, interactive system (Abbott 2016). Respondents indicated that ancillary organizations play an important role in ecological systems by encouraging creative interaction between their own agents and journalists, between traditional and data journalists, and between journalists and entities outside the journalism space such as data scientists. Such interaction fosters creative responses to problems, and may demystify and reduce uncertainty about change and innovation for the overall system. This allows for modeling and mimicry among entities, encouraging legitimacy and the potential emergence of new populations (Lowrey, 2013; Weber, Fulk, and Monge, 2016). Findings also suggest that ancillary organizations are themselves adapting, collaborating and collectively rethinking goals, practices and criteria for success.", "Finally, both approaches suggest potential dysfunction in the innovation process. From a field theory perspective, strategic agency is needed to take new positions in the field, but such efforts may encourage a kind of dogma, as suggested in the missionary rhetoric of data journalists, and in deterministic notions that data journalism\u2019s growth is natural or inevitable. From an ecology perspective, mimicry can aid the spread of something new, but the result may be less-than-rational copying and a fascination with appearing progressive.", "Additional research involving surveys of journalists and ancillary organizations would allow for implications about the wider journalism field \u2013 findings from this study cannot be generalized beyond the accounts of the individuals interviewed. Additional qualitative research involving observation of data journalism and ancillary organizations would shed more light and add trustworthiness. Results suggest innovation processes vary across international contexts; for example, media development agencies seem particularly important to innovation and change efforts in some countries. Results also indicate tech companies, which are not represented in this study\u2019s sample, are playing an increasingly significant role in innovation.", "Findings point to the importance of understanding the wider social, political and economic contexts within which innovation takes place, and the impact that turning the conceptual prism can have on that understanding. Findings also show what can be lost when viewing social phenomena from one framework, and that the contexts and dynamics of journalism change and innovation may be understood more fully as both a field and an ecological phenomenon."]}], "references": [{"title": "Linked Ecologies: States and Universities as Environments for Professions", "year": "2005", "journal": "Sociological Theory", "volume": "23", "authors": [{"name": "Abbott Andrew.", "first_name": "Abbott", "last_name": "Andrew."}]}, {"title": "Can Foundations Solve the Journalism Crisis?", "year": "2018", "journal": "Journalism", "volume": "19", "authors": [{"name": "Benson Rodney.", "first_name": "Benson", "last_name": "Rodney."}]}, {"title": "Losing Their \u2018Mojo\u2019?", "year": "2016", "journal": "Journalism Practice", "volume": "10", "authors": [{"name": "Blankenship Justin.", "first_name": "Blankenship", "last_name": "Justin."}]}, {"title": "Making Time: Temporality, History and the Cultural Object", "year": "2015", "journal": "New Literary History", "volume": "46", "authors": [{"name": "Born Georgina.", "first_name": "Born", "last_name": "Georgina."}]}, {"title": "\u201cBuilding an Audience, Bonding a City: Digital News Production as a Field of Care.\u201d Media", "year": "2017", "journal": "Culture \\& Society", "volume": "39", "authors": [{"name": "Boyles Jan Lauren.", "first_name": "Boyles", "last_name": "Lauren."}]}, {"title": "The Extended Case Method", "year": "1998", "journal": "Sociological Theory", "volume": "16", "authors": [{"name": "Burawoy Michael.", "first_name": "Burawoy", "last_name": "Michael."}]}, {"title": "Mapping the Sports Journalism Field: Bourdieu and Broadsheet Newsrooms", "year": "2016", "journal": "Journalism", "volume": "17", "authors": [{"name": "English Peter.", "first_name": "", "last_name": "Peter."}]}, {"title": "Data Journalism in the United States: Beyond the \u2018Usual Suspects.\u2019", "year": "2015", "journal": "Journalism Studies", "volume": "16", "authors": [{"name": "Fink Katherine", "first_name": "Fink", "last_name": "Katherine"}, {"name": "Anderson C.
