Ritter, was founded to educate the public about science. The overarching aims of the Service were to instill in the public a scientific habit of mind and improve the public's critical thinking skills, thereby strengthening democracy. The Service acted as a liaison between scientists and the public by disseminating accessible scientific information through a variety of media, including The Science News-Letter. Service founders maintained that the agency would not promulgate propaganda \u201cunless it be propaganda to urge the value of research and the usefulness of science.\u201d Between the first and second world wars, the Service began an anti-propaganda campaign in its newsletter; cautioning readers about the dangers of propaganda, describing how to recognize propaganda, and explaining how to defend against it \u2013 providing the public with \u201cpsychological armor\u201d in the words of Science Service writer, Marjorie Van de Water. Between 1926 and 1965, 187 newsletter articles included the keyword \u201cpropaganda.\u201d This essay identifies, examines, and places in context, newsletter articles on propaganda and argues that, in spite of the organization's stated mission, aspects of its counterpropaganda crusade veered into the realm of propaganda.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Science Service (the Service), established in 1921 as a grand experiment in science popularization, embraced educational philosopher, John Dewey's, pragmatic philosophy of science education \u2013 that the public was capable of understanding the methods as well as the facts of science (Dewey 1910; Ritter 1926a; Davis 1948).1", "Dewey distinguished the subject matter of science, the accumulated facts that comprised much of science education in his time, from the method of science, \u201cthe processes by which something fit to be called knowledge is brought into existence, and order introduced into the flux of experience\u201d (Dewey 1910, 125). It was understanding the processes of science, Dewey maintained, that instilled in students the proper \u201cscientific habit of mind\u201d (Dewey 1910; Rhees 1979; Bennet 2013). One of the only two articles that remain in my creed of life is that the future of our civilization depends upon the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind; and that the problem of problems in our education is therefore to discover how to mature and make effective this scientific habit. (Dewey 1910, 127)", "One of the only two articles that remain in my creed of life is that the future of our civilization depends upon the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind; and that the problem of problems in our education is therefore to discover how to mature and make effective this scientific habit. (Dewey 1910, 127)", "After mulling over ideas for a long-imagined pet project, which he called The American Society for the Dissemination of Science, newspaper magnate and Science Service founder, Edward Willis \u201cE.W.\u201d Scripps, proposed a news service that would distribute to the public well-written, easily-accessible science information (Scripps 1919). Through its publications and other activities, the new organization would bridge the widening gap between scientists and the public.2 This approach, of course, assumed that the public's deficit in science knowledge could be corrected by providing more and better science information.3", "Scripps maintained that the organization should provide scientific facts and data, avoid propagandizing, and eschew partisanship (Scripps 1919, 30\u201331). However, in the years immediately preceding U.S. entry into World War II, at a time when the country was debating its isolationist stance, the Science Service engaged in a fervent and paternalistic anti-propaganda campaign, publishing articles on the dangers of propaganda in its Science News-Letter (News-Letter).", "This campaign was driven in part by the 1929 hiring of Marjorie Van de Water, a one-time employee of the Bureau of Standards, the National Research Council, and the U.S. Civil Service Commission, who became a psychology writer for the Service. Van de Water's tendency to engage in what we now call advocacy journalism and her connections to social science organizations with reformist goals \u2013 organizations like the Institute for Propaganda Analysis (IPA) and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI) helped shape the News-Letter's anti-propaganda agenda.", "A 1937 editorial in the Oregon Statesman Journal noted a conundrum \u2013 what one might call a propaganda trap \u2013 created by the propaganda analysis movement, one of the movements Van de Water touted in the News-Letter. [Edward Filene's] money is now being used to set up an institute for the analysis of propaganda. That is as much needed an agency as the times offer at present. But it may speedily become merely an institute to propagandize about propaganda. (\u201cPropaganda Analysis\u201d 1937)", "[Edward Filene's] money is now being used to set up an institute for the analysis of propaganda. That is as much needed an agency as the times offer at present. But it may speedily become merely an institute to propagandize about propaganda. (\u201cPropaganda Analysis\u201d 1937)", "As twenty-first century American philosopher and political scientist, Jason Brennan penned in 2017, \u201cIf you write on propaganda, people will ask whether your work is an instance of propaganda.\u201d (41)", "This essay identifies and places in context for the first time, anti-propaganda articles published in the News-Letter during the inter-world-war era, throughout World War II, and during the post-World-War II era until the News-Letter was subsumed by its successor, Science News, in 1966 (Davis 1966; \u201cScience Service Evolves\u201d 2008). Although there has been some historical research on the Science Service and its activities, there are many gaps to be filled regarding the News-Letter. This essay begins to fill some of those gaps by studying the evolution of the News-Letter as both a conduit for science knowledge and a medium for anti-propaganda advocacy. Examining the News-Letter's historical role as an idealistic but imperfect vehicle to improve the public understanding of science is relevant to a world in which the proliferation of \u201calternative facts\u201d threatens to undermine truth, science, and the role of expertise."]}, {"title": "Birth of the Science Service and its Newsletter", "paragraphs": ["As early as 1913, Edwin Emery Slosson, Ph.D., a chemist and popularizer of science who would become the first director of the Service, recognized the need for popular science writers who would inform the public about scientific discoveries and counter journalists\u2019 negative view of scientists. In an address before Columbia University's school of journalism, Slosson noted \u201c\u2009\u2026\u2009the dominant attitude of the popular press toward men of science is one of contempt and ridicule\u201d (Slosson 1913, 914). Newspapers and magazines failed to recognize the merits of scientific achievements, explained Slosson, and reporters were often incapable of remedying the problem. \u201c[W]hen it comes to science itself,\u201d Slosson wrote, \u201cthe ordinary reporter is all at sea\u201d (Slosson 1913, 915).", "By 1919 E.W. Scripps \u2013 retired from active management of his publishing empire for nearly a decade \u2013 was looking for new challenges. He bemoaned the fact that newspapers spread \u201ca vast quantity of misinformation\u201d and complained about the dearth of accurate, understandable information about scientific discoveries (Scripps 1919, 306). Most scientific information was locked in technical publications inaccessible to ordinary citizens (Scripps 1919; Foust 1995).", "Scripps, Slosson, and other founders of the Science Service thought they had a solution for these concerns \u2013 an organization that would increase the public understanding of science and its methods via the reports of capable science journalists. The Service, its publications, and other activities would foster the scientific habit of mind Dewey and Service founders thought was necessary for democracy \u2013 and civilization itself \u2013 to survive and flourish. (Slosson 1921; Dewey 1910).", "W.E. Ritter, Scripps's close friend and a prominent zoologist, was an ally and associate on both the Science Service project and the Scripps Institution of Biological Research at La Jolla, California, another of Scripps's ventures. In 1921 Ritter was appointed president of the Service board of directors, a position he held for many years (\u201cWilliam Emerson Ritter, 1856\u20131944\u201d 1944). In an elegy after Scripps's death, Ritter wrote about the significance of science to his collaborator. It is useless [Scripps] said in effect, to think of making the world safe for democracy without thinking also for making democracy safe for itself; and the only possible way of making democracy thus safe is to make it more intelligent. But since to be intelligent is utterly impossible without having much of the knowledge, the method, and the spirit of science, the only way to make democracy safe is to make it more scientific. (Ritter 1926b, 6\u20137)", "It is useless [Scripps] said in effect, to think of making the world safe for democracy without thinking also for making democracy safe for itself; and the only possible way of making democracy thus safe is to make it more intelligent. But since to be intelligent is utterly impossible without having much of the knowledge, the method, and the spirit of science, the only way to make democracy safe is to make it more scientific. (Ritter 1926b, 6\u20137)", "Explaining the difference between real science and pseudoscience was also part of the organization's pledge, Slosson noted: \u201c[t]he success of democratic government as well as the prosperity of the individual may be said to depend upon the ability of the people to distinguish between real science and fake, between the genuine expert and the pretender\u201d (Slosson 1921, 321).", "Scripps proposed a journalist editor who would place Service articles in daily and weekly newspapers (Scripps 1919, 302). He took a broad view of the term \u201cscience,\u201d and included in his list of possible topics for the Service to cover: the League of Nations, public ownership of railroads and telegraph lines, the Spanish influenza, and prohibition \u2013 topics with significant political overtones that, with the exception of the Spanish influenza, had little to do with science (Scripps 1919, 305\u2013306; Anderson 2013; Giocoli 2015; Spinney 2017; Wertheim 2011). Slosson had a different view of the content the Service would provide: It would be improper and undesirable for the S.N.S. [Science News Service] to engage in propaganda on pending political and sociological questions yet it could contribute to the correct solution of these questions by providing what is much more needed than argument, that is, accurate data. (Slosson 1919, 314)", "It would be improper and undesirable for the S.N.S. [Science News Service] to engage in propaganda on pending political and sociological questions yet it could contribute to the correct solution of these questions by providing what is much more needed than argument, that is, accurate data. (Slosson 1919, 314)", "Slosson envisioned a science news agency, not an organization whose writers would opine about political issues. He hoped the Service might \u201crevive the Golden Age of Popular Science when such men as Faraday, Tyndall, Huxley and Darwin were read by all classes\u201d (Slosson 1919, 310). The agency would produce short, science news articles (provided for free to all newspapers or periodicals) and special articles paid for by magazines, Sunday papers, and newspaper syndicates (Slosson 1919, 308).", "To further his vision, Slosson recommended a board of directors composed of both scientists and journalists, a group of advisers who were university professors and researchers, and a corps of contributors (Slosson 1919, 309\u2013311). Service writers would all be intermediaries who could \u201cunderstand equally the language of the laboratory and of the street,\u201d (Slosson 1928, 136). Stories by bright young graduate students were a good source of articles, observed Slosson. Even though young writers might be unknown or anonymous, it wouldn't matter. American readers would not recognize the names of scientific authorities anyway \u201cfor they do not know who are the real authorities\u201d (Slosson 1919, 310\u2013311).", "Slosson suggested that the Service might also act as a clearing house by providing accurate scientific facts and figures to the public. A lecture bureau, motion pictures, and a popular science periodical were also on Slosson's wish list. Many of Slosson's recommendations were integrated into the Service (Slosson 1919, 312\u2013314; \u201cFront Matter\u201d 1932).", "At the time Scripps was formulating his proposal for a science news service, the use and abuse of propaganda in World War I was much on the minds of American scholars and members of the public (Dodge 1920; Lasswell 1928, 1938). As Lasswell wrote in 1928, \u201c[t]he public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great deal of lamentation over it. Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate\u2009\u2026\u2009.\u201d (260).", "Scripps and other Service founders were determined to keep propaganda out of the Service, a stance which became a central tenet of the organization's philosophy. The first aim of this institution should be just the reverse of what is called propaganda. Its objects should never be to furnish argument or facts for the purpose of producing partisans for any particular cause. Its sole object should be to present facts in readable and interesting form \u2013 facts on which the reader could and probably would base his opinion on a subject of politics, sociology or concerning his duty with regard to himself and with regard to his fellows (Scripps 1919, 306).", "The first aim of this institution should be just the reverse of what is called propaganda.

The following year, a newsletter in the form of a typed and mimeographed bulletin was distributed to subscribers. Still later, a version of the bulletin, re-packaged and upgraded with features of interest to the general public, was sent to science teachers, librarians, and other interested parties. By 1926, the original mimeographed bulletin had become The Science News-Letter, a more substantial publication (\u201cFront Matter\u201d 1932; Gillis 1997; Siegfried 2008).", "In \u201cA New Agency for the Popularization of Science,\u201d published in the journal Science, Slosson reiterated the agency's view of propaganda. [The Science Service] will not be under the control of any clique, class or commercial interest. It will not be the organ of any one association. It will serve all the sciences. It will supply any of the news syndicates. It will not indulge in propaganda unless it be propaganda to urge the value of research and the usefulness of science. (Slosson 1921, 322)", "[The Science Service] will not be under the control of any clique, class or commercial interest. It will not be the organ of any one association. It will serve all the sciences. It will supply any of the news syndicates. It will not indulge in propaganda unless it be propaganda to urge the value of research and the usefulness of science. (Slosson 1921, 322)", "As the political climate in Europe deteriorated and the United States was drawn into a second world war, the News-Letter, which (in spite of Slosson's recommendation) had a tendency to take on political issues, began an anti-propaganda campaign. Archived issues of the News-Letter, contemporaneous articles and writings by founders and leaders of the Service as well as scholarly writings relevant to the philosophy and activities of the Science Service shed light on the News-Letter's dual character as a medium to educate the public about science and as a vehicle to indulge the political sentiments and social concerns of Science Service founders, staff writers, and contributors.", "The News-Letter's anti-propaganda campaign; its articles supporting eugenics (a favorite topic of E.W. Scripps); its defense of Goodwin Watson, a governmental propaganda analyst and psychologist accused by the Kerr and Dies Committees of being unfit for public office; and the publication of anti-war articles are examples of the News-Letter's more politically-infused coverage.4,5 While well-identified editorials were sometimes included in the newsletter, the publication regularly mingled opinion or advocacy with science news without adequately identifying opinion pieces, a practice frowned upon by the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE Code of Ethics 1923).6", "The Service and its News-Letter left an indelible mark on the field of science journalism, setting a standard by which scientists and journalists would interact. Service stories were placed in many well-respected U.S. newspapers (Nelkin 1987; Foust 1995; Bennet 2013). During the organization's heyday in the 1940s, it mailed news and features to more than 100 news outlets (many of them Scripps outlets) and had a combined circulation of more than 30 million (Boffey 1970)."]}, {"title": "Propaganda Consciousness in Early to Mid twentieth Century America", "paragraphs": ["According to Sproule (1984, 1987, 1989), propaganda consciousness in early twentieth-century America was lacking and politics was considered a rational expression of public opinion in a democratic society. The possibility that special interests could control or manipulate public opinion was not understood nor had influences on public opinion been the subject of much, if any, serious study (Sproule 1984, 1987, 1989). Revelations concerning World War I propaganda \u2013 British, German, and the zealously pro-American version distributed by George Creel and the U.S. Committee on Public Information \u2013 led to the public's disillusionment with government and frustration with its citizens\u2019 gullibility (Dodge 1920; Lasswell 1938; Sproule 1984, 1987, 1989).", "With the evolution of a more critical view of American society \u2013 revealed in the works of muckrakers like Upton Sinclair and journalism critics like Will Irwin \u2013 scholars began to explore reasons for the vulnerability and malleability of public opinion (Sinclair 1906; Irwin 1969; Sproule 1987). Freud's exploration of the unconscious contributed to the emerging theory that public opinion could be manipulated. The impact of unconscious thought and suppressed urges, as described by Freud, suggested that irrational processes might make members of the public susceptible to persuasion (Freud 1990; Sproule 1987).", "The works of Walter Lippmann and Harold Lasswell unmasked propaganda's role in the formation of public opinion, paving the way for other propaganda scholars (Lippmann 1922; Lasswell 1928, 1938). In 1937 the Institute for Propaganda Analysis (IPA) was established by Clyde Miller, an educator at the Columbia University Teachers College. The IPA's practical paradigm for propaganda analysis and its historical-critical approach helped shape the U.S. attitude toward propaganda via the organization's monthly bulletin and its detailed school curricula (Edwards 1938; Miller 1938; Lee and Lee 1939; |Sproule 1987, 2001).", "Although propaganda analysis was ultimately displaced by communications research with its more sophisticated theoretical underpinnings and statistically-based methods, the IPA left its mark on the News-Letter. The strength of propaganda analysis was that it empowered media consumers to analyze media messages for \u201cdevices\u201d that might unconsciously influence them. Sproule noted that \u201cthe propaganda analysts reflected the progressive view that democracy required increased popular participation\u201d (Sproule 1989, 226). Propaganda analysis dovetailed with the Service's ideas about science education and especially with the organization's desire to increase public participation in democracy. IPA propaganda analysis techniques offered News-Letter readers a means to recognize and eliminate the evils of propaganda in their own lives. Propaganda was not, however, as easy to recognize and defuse as the IPA's devices might suggest.", "In spite of early-to-mid twentieth century advances in the study of propaganda, a definition of the term was still elusive when the News-Letter began its anti-propaganda campaign. W.T. Brande provided an early definition of propaganda in his 1842 dictionary. Derived from [the congregation de propaganda Fide], the name propaganda [original emphasis] is applied in modern political language as a term of reproach to secret associations for the spread of opinion and principles which are viewed by most governments with horror and aversion. (Brande 1842; 991 as cited by Black 2001 and references therein)", "Derived from [the congregation de propaganda Fide], the name propaganda [original emphasis] is applied in modern political language as a term of reproach to secret associations for the spread of opinion and principles which are viewed by most governments with horror and aversion.

Interestingly, Dodge also said that disarming propaganda by labeling it as such was \u201cinadequate\u201d as a defense (Dodge 1920, 242). Neutralizing propagandistic messages by categorizing them was at the heart of the IPA's propaganda analysis protocol.", "In 1938, Hadley Cantril, a psychologist and IPA president, explained the IPA's definition of propaganda: Our definition will be that propaganda is expression of opinion or action by individuals or groups deliberately designed to influence opinions or actions of other individuals or groups with reference to predetermined ends. This definition implies several things. First, that propaganda is a positive thing, that it is well planned, that it is selfish, that it is noncritical, making use of suggestion and not reason, and, finally, that it may be good or bad, depending upon the social point of view of the individual judging it.

The approach of war and a multitude of cataclysmic world events contributed to the increase in articles with political overtones, including articles about propaganda (see Table 1).

Wallace also alluded to the role the Service might play in the trying years to come, ending on an optimistic note about the future of science, a future where scientists would be agents for peace rather than advocates of war. The scientists who express themselves through Science Service know how important it is that the science of the future should be an agent of peace and abundance instead of warfare and exploitation. In the year or two immediately ahead, we have a tremendous job to do in defeating those who are using science for propaganda and destruction.

After eliminating book titles, book reviews, advertisements, errata, and back or front matter that included the word propaganda, 187 articles remained. The majority of these articles included one incidental mention of the word \u201cpropaganda\u201d (with \u201cincidental mention\u201d defined as use of the term \u201cpropaganda\u201d in passing, such as in the phrase \u201chealth propaganda;\u201d as a substitute term for advertising or educational materials; or in a context with little relation to politics). The remaining articles addressed propaganda more substantially \u2013 in the context of politics, power, and war (no matter how brief the reference was) or focused on propaganda examples, dangers, and strategies by which the public could recognize and battle propaganda's \u201cinsidious assault against intelligence\u201d (Van de Water 1938).", "The year 1929 divides News-Letter history into the pre- and post-Van de Water eras. Only two articles of significance concerning propaganda were published prior to Van de Water's arrival, an article reiterating the Service's commitment to avoid propaganda (Science Service 1926) and an excerpt from British author Arthur Ponsonby's book Falsehood in War-Time: The psychological factor in war is just as important as the military factor.\u2009\u2026\u2009so victories must be exaggerated and defeats, if not concealed, at any rate minimized, and the stimulus of indignation, horror, and hatred must be assiduously and continuously pumped into the public mind by means of \u2018propaganda\u2019. (Ponsonby 1928, 2; 1929)", "The psychological factor in war is just as important as the military factor.\u2009\u2026\u2009so victories must be exaggerated and defeats, if not concealed, at any rate minimized, and the stimulus of indignation, horror, and hatred must be assiduously and continuously pumped into the public mind by means of \u2018propaganda\u2019. (Ponsonby 1928, 2; 1929)", "In the decade after Van de Water joined the Service, the number of articles referencing propaganda (including incidental mentions) increased nearly five-fold \u2013 from fourteen articles to sixty-nine. In 1932, the News-Letter summarized a Science Service conference where the question, \u201cAre the social sciences really science?\u201d was debated (\u201cSocial Sciences Debated\u201d 1932; \u201cScience Service Conference\u201d 1932).", "It was reported that in this conference debate, E.W. Scripps's son, Robert P. Scripps (then editorial director of the Scripps-Howard newspapers) supported \u201cadding the so-called social sciences to the scope of Science Service's work\u201d (\u201cSocial Sciences Debated\u201d 1932; \u201cScience Service Conference\u201d 1932).", "From its inception, however, the Service accepted social science as worthy of the designation \u201cscience\u201d (Scripps 1919, 306). The News-Letter had in fact published articles about social science since at least 1924, included social science in its book lists, and hired Van de Water in 1929 to cover psychology (Psychological Research Planned 1924; Marjorie Van de Water Dies 1962). It appears that the News-Letter answered the question \u201cAre the social sciences really science?\u201d in the affirmative, by virtue of its extensive coverage of the topic. The recognition of politics as a branch of psychology merely added a new subtopic to the News-Letter's already extensive social science repertoire (\u201cPolitics Gets Recognition\u201d 1936).", "By the early to mid 1930s, the News-Letter's anti-propaganda campaign had ramped up and more substantive articles about propaganda were published. A News-Letter story titled \u201cScientist Gives Principles for Practical Propaganda\u201d (1932) deconstructed the methods of propagandists using propaganda \u201cprinciples\u201d developed by Dr. Knight Dunlap, a Johns Hopkins professor of psychology and president of the American Psychological Association in 1922 (\u201cFormer APA Presidents\u201d 2018). According to Dunlap, the conditioning process making an audience susceptible to propaganda included: applying systemic and incessant repetition; avoiding argument and never admitting that the issue has another side; connecting the propaganda with the wishes of the audience; using clearly repeatable statements, indirection, innuendo, and implication; and (for the most permanent results) aiming propaganda at children (\u201cScientist Gives Principles\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d 1932).", "The Institute for Propaganda Analysis, incorporated on 23 September 1937, devoted itself to analyzing propaganda via the application of seven simplistic and sometimes overlapping devices to suspected propaganda. These devices: name calling, glittering generalities, transfer, testimonial, plain folks, card stacking, and band wagon, were easy to explain to a lay audience. In 1939, the institute published The Fine Art of Propaganda: a study of Father Coughlin's speeches, providing a case study for those desiring to learn the IPA's approach (Lee and Lee 1939). The News-Letter listed this book and several other IPA publications in its new books sections (\u201cNew Books\u201d 1939; \u201cFirst ||Glances\u201d 1940, 1941a, 1941b).", "\u201cPropaganda Analysis May Protect You Against it\u201d was published in the News-Letter on December 25, 1937 (Van de Water 1937a). The article had no byline, but was clearly written by Van de Water as it was published with her byline in at least one newspaper (Van de Water 1937b). After explaining the IPA's seven devices and offering examples of each, Van de Water ended with amusing advice to the reader. If you keep this list of propaganda devices in mind and watch for them in radio talks, in articles on politics or current topics, even in the arguments of your friends, you will be amused to see them cropping up again and again and in this mood your emotions may not be carried away. (Van de Water 1937a, 1937b)", "If you keep this list of propaganda devices in mind and watch for them in radio talks, in articles on politics or current topics, even in the arguments of your friends, you will be amused to see them cropping up again and again and in this mood your emotions may not be carried away. (Van de Water 1937a, 1937b)", "Eighteen articles containing more than a cursory mention of the word propaganda appeared in the News-Letter from 1937 through 1939 (see Figures 1 and 2). One of the most noteworthy pieces appearing under Van de Water's byline was an article titled \u201cPropaganda: An Insidious Assault Upon the Intelligence, Psychology Warns You How to Recognize it\u201d (Van de Water 1938). Here Van de Water described a second simple rubric with which her readers could identify propaganda. The new rubric listed six \u201cearmarks\u201d of propaganda including: appealing to the emotions; using slogans; concealing the source of the propaganda; urging haste in decision-making; using indirection, innuendo, insinuation and suggestion; and taking advantage of strong connections to church, government, freedom, honor, and family (Van de Water 1938).", "The 14 October 1939 issue of the News-Letter, published a matter of weeks after Germany invaded Poland, contained another anti-propaganda article with a third rubric for recognizing propaganda: \u201cTen Commandments Offered for Propaganda\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d (Van de Water 1939a, 1939b, 1939c).", "Other News-Letter articles referencing propaganda during this time period included a piece about the re-discovered files of George Creel's Committee on Public Information, an article deconstructing German propaganda, and commentary by Kurt Lewin on new methods of propaganda that might be used in the \u201cEuropean war\u201d (\u201cHow to Sell a War\u201d 1939; \u201cHitler\u2019s Danzig Threat\u201d 1939; Lewin 1939).", "News-Letter propaganda articles diminished considerably by mid-1942, likely due to the waning of the IPA's influence, the fact that the U.S. had declared war on Germany and Japan, and the establishment of the Office of Censorship under Byron Price in 1941 (Sweeney 2001). In the final issue of the IPA's bulletin, the organization terminated its activities for the duration of the war as (for the sake of consistency) continuing would require IPA analysis of all (including U.S.) propaganda. IPA analysis of U.S. propaganda was considered divisive to the war effort (Gerber 1942; IPA 1941).", "When World War II ended, the pace and intensity of the Service's anti-propaganda campaign continued to diminish (see Figures 1 and 2). Between October 1945 and June 1948, only eight News-Letter articles mentioned the word propaganda, and the articles with the most significant discussion of the topic referenced propaganda in the context of its influence on voting (\u201cPropaganda Can Change Your Mind on Voting\u201d 1948; Van de Water 1948). One article on post-war resistance of the Japanese people did not use the word \u201cpropaganda\u201d at all, but mentioned the related term \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d From the late 1940s through 1965, many of the News-Letter's propaganda-related articles referenced the Soviet Union as a technological, military, or propaganda threat. The last News-Letter article mentioning propaganda referenced anti-vivisectionist propaganda, a bugaboo for scientists who used animal models in their research (\u201cAntivivisection Bill Hit\u201d 1965)."]}, {"title": "Did The Science News-Letter Propagandize its Readers?", "paragraphs": ["Many News-Letter articles examined as part of this project used advocacy, opinion, and calls to action to influence public opinion on a variety of issues. In some instances, there was a nexus between the position advocated and a scientific issue, but in many cases, the issue under consideration was purely political. The manner in which each of the many articles collected deviated from the original mission of the Service is beyond the scope of this discussion, which will focus on propaganda techniques used in selected News-Letter articles.", "Several otherwise mundane News-Letter articles referenced the \u201cpropaganda of fear\u201d \u2013 instilling fear in readers in order to modify behavior (\u201cPeril on the Road\u201d 1936; \u201cTermites Now Known\u201d 1936). A related device, the fear appeal, a technique not clearly identified and studied by scholars until decades after the News-Letter's prime, is a narrative technique often used in propaganda messages (Conway, Grabe, and Grieves 2007). According to Tannenbaum et al. (2015) \u201c[f]ear appeals are persuasive messages that attempt to arouse fear by emphasizing the potential danger and harm that will befall individuals if they do not adopt the messages\u2019 recommendations\u201d (1179).", "Further examination of three previously-mentioned Van de Water propaganda articles, published in 1937, 1938, and 1939, suggests that the News-Letter propagandized its own readers. For example, all three of these articles began with a fear appeal, warning readers that they might lose their ability to make rational decisions if they became victims of war propaganda. Van de Water\u2019s 1937 article began with an emotional appeal suggesting that unwitting consumers of media would regret actions taken under the influence of propagandistic messages: Powerful weapon in war and peace, in education and in delusion, is artful propaganda. Rousing emotions, deliberately avoiding appeals to the intellect, propaganda is potent in producing action without deliberation. Under its influence, men and women may assume and perform acts that later in sober retrospect are sincerely regretted. (Van de Water 1937a, 410)", "Powerful weapon in war and peace, in education and in delusion, is artful propaganda.", "Rousing emotions, deliberately avoiding appeals to the intellect, propaganda is potent in producing action without deliberation. Under its influence, men and women may assume and perform acts that later in sober retrospect are sincerely regretted. (Van de Water 1937a, 410)", "The only defense, wrote Van de Water, was to use the newest tool of the social scientist \u2013 \u201cpropaganda analysis.\u201d The article also included a plug for the IPA's bulletin (which members of the public could purchase). Examination and analysis of propaganda is the only defense of the consumer against such unconsidered action. Aid is given in a discussion of common propaganda devices contained in the current issue of \u201cPropaganda Analysis.\u201d (Van de Water 1937a, 410)", "Examination and analysis of propaganda is the only defense of the consumer against such unconsidered action. Aid is given in a discussion of common propaganda devices contained in the current issue of \u201cPropaganda Analysis.\u201d (Van de Water 1937a, 410)", "A second important Van de Water article began with this scenario: They cut off the hands of little children. Bombs were dropped on a group of playing orphans. Old ladies were beaten and tortured. No nation of integrity could stand by and permit such outrages. Massacre! Brutality! Insult! You recognize these phrases. They are war propaganda. (Van de Water 1938, 234)", "They cut off the hands of little children. Bombs were dropped on a group of playing orphans. Old ladies were beaten and tortured. No nation of integrity could stand by and permit such outrages. Massacre! Brutality! Insult!", "You recognize these phrases. They are war propaganda. (Van de Water 1938, 234)", "Van de Water followed this attention-grabbing, fear-inducing lede with an admonishment that readers should follow her advice to learn the public's \u201conly weapon\u201d against the influence of war propaganda, that weapon being the ability to recognize earmarks of the propagandist \u2013 with the help of experts in psychology. Your only weapon against the onslaught of this most modern and most effective of all the instruments of war is a knowledge of the rules by which the propagandist works. Psychologists have studied this art. They know how to use propaganda. They can also put you on your guard against it. (Van de Water 1938, 234)", "Your only weapon against the onslaught of this most modern and most effective of all the instruments of war is a knowledge of the rules by which the propagandist works. Psychologists have studied this art. They know how to use propaganda. They can also put you on your guard against it. (Van de Water 1938, 234)", "A third Van de Water article followed the pattern of the previous articles. First came Van de Water's fear appeal: Before the great guns, the torpedoes and the bombs went into action in the European war, propaganda battles were already being won and lost in the minds of men the world over\u2009\u2026\u2009.The American citizen\u2009\u2026\u2009needs psychological armor against the bombardment of propaganda from interested sources the world over. The present \u201cno-man's land\u201d where greatest propaganda activity is focused may very well be in American homes. (Van de Water 1939, 250)", "Before the great guns, the torpedoes and the bombs went into action in the European war, propaganda battles were already being won and lost in the minds of men the world over\u2009\u2026\u2009.The American citizen\u2009\u2026\u2009needs psychological armor against the bombardment of propaganda from interested sources the world over.", "The present \u201cno-man's land\u201d where greatest propaganda activity is focused may very well be in American homes. (Van de Water 1939, 250)", "Then Van de Water advised her readers to follow ten commandments of propaganda protection: Here are ten commandments of propaganda protection. They are based on a warning issued by the Council of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, a scientific organization of leading social psychologists. It is suggested that you paste them up over your radio and keep them in mind as you hear or read dispatches from warring nations. (Van de Water 1939, 250)", "Here are ten commandments of propaganda protection. They are based on a warning issued by the Council of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, a scientific organization of leading social psychologists.", "It is suggested that you paste them up over your radio and keep them in mind as you hear or read dispatches from warring nations. (Van de Water 1939, 250)", "All three articles described above suggested that a rational, scientific (and psychologist-sanctioned) approach to analyzing media messages could and would save News-Letter readers from the evils of propaganda. Although well-intentioned, the rhetoric in these articles relied upon some of the very techniques Van de Water advised her readers to resist. Van de Water appealed to her readers\u2019 emotions; gave insistent, repetitive advice; and urged her readers to jump on one of three propaganda analysis bandwagons (six earmarks, seven devices or ten commandments)."]}, {"title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["The Science News-Letter's paternalistic anti-propaganda campaign was inconsistent with Slosson and Scripps's original vision of a Society for the Dissemination of Science and with Dewey's idealistic views on the educability of the public. Fear of propaganda uprooted those idealistic visions and paradoxically led to a campaign employing the same devices the campaign condemned in order to \u201ceducate\u201d the News-Letter's audience about the dangers of propagandistic messages.", "The Service's anti-propaganda battle is still of interest for a number reasons. First, the simple descriptions of propaganda devices and techniques resonate in this era of misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, and spin. While the rubrics promoted by the Service were indeed simplistic and perhaps misguided, that very simplicity empowered the News-Letter's audience, providing action plans with which readers could combat a menace they might encounter on the radio, in pamphlets mailed to them, or in the newspapers left at their doorsteps.", "Second, while the psychological mechanisms that shape public opinion are better (although not completely) understood today, a few of the concepts described in News-Letter anti-propaganda articles survive the test of time. We know that repetition increases the strength and longevity of a propaganda message, we see how effective mixing a little bit of truth with a lot of untruth can be, and we desperately seek ways to counter propaganda messages without amplifying them in this era of \u201calternative facts.\u201d", "Third, understanding how and why The Science News-Letter went off track with its anti-propaganda propaganda is instructive to those who debate contentiously with the \u201calternative fact\u201d contingent. A fervent belief in the righteousness of one's position does not guarantee that one's own message is objective, accurate, effective, and not itself propagandistic. The propaganda trap can be irresistible.", "Lastly, the temptation to believe that science can always show the way forward on difficult public policy issues should be avoided. Using evidence-based analysis in public policy decision-making is as essential now as it was in the News-Letter's heyday, but setting up scientists as members of a privileged intelligentsia or priesthood tasked with making science policy decisions without public input (and sometimes without transparency) is the kind of patronizing elitism that, all too often, alienates the very audience with which scientists are attempting to communicate. Scientific expertise should be respected but also questioned when appropriate. As Wesley C. Mitchell, the retiring president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) reportedly said in 1939: As teachers in schools and colleges we can help thousands to develop respect for evidence. As citizens we can be brave opponents of prejudice and hysteria. We can promote general understanding of the methods and results of science through our own writings or those of allies more skilled in popular exposition. These things we should do, not as high priests assured that they are always right, but as workers who have learned a method of treating problems that wins cumulative successes, and who would like to share that method with others. (\u201cCall To Action\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d 1939, 419)", "As teachers in schools and colleges we can help thousands to develop respect for evidence.

(\u201cCall To Action\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d 1939, 419)", "While debates still occasionally arise regarding the value of social science and the necessity of funding for social science research, the field has much to offer researchers on the public understanding of science. In fact, social scientists are beginning to understand the dynamics driving the public's increasingly polarized views of scientific and political issues (see Kahan, Jamieson, and Scheufele 2017).", "In spite of the limitations of the News-Letter's anti-propaganda campaign, there might be merit in re-visiting, clarifying, and updating the three anti-propaganda rubrics Van de Water promoted.
