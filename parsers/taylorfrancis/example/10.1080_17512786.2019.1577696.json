Yet journalists covering Trump often fail to capture the uniquely damaging nature of his rhetoric, instead reconstructing Trump\u2019s speech into coherent, \u201cpresidential\u201d narratives. Using Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s concept of carnival, a medieval festival of multivocal ridicule and renewal, this analysis of two reporters\u2019 live tweets from a 2018 Trump rally unpacks competing approaches to framing Trump\u2019s post-normative rhetoric: a dominant approach representing traditional \u201cobjectivity\u201d that squeezes his speeches into expected patterns of presidential communication, and an alternative approach that exposes Trump\u2019s hybridization of carnivalesque subversion with his official role as head of state.

During a rambling 80-minute address, Trump mocked and berated the news media: adopting a pompous, mimicking tone, insisting that reporters regularly invented sources and refused to report his accomplishments, and calling most of them \u201cvery dishonest people.\u201d Trump also effected a haughty, stuttering mimicry of former FBI director James Comey, called him \u201ca liar and a leaker,\u201d and insisted he had done supporters \u201ca great favor\u201d by firing him in early 2017. Trump insulted Democrats as a party, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t care about our military.\u2009\u2026\u2009And they don\u2019t care about our borders. And I don\u2019t think they care much about crime.\u201d Trump threatened to reveal unspecified damaging information about Montana Sen. John Tester because Tester had raised concerns about a cabinet nominee. Trump expressed admiration for Chinese President Xi Jinping, calling him \u201cthe Boss,\u201d while deriding former US Secretary of State John Kerry and calling California Gov. Jerry Brown \u201cMoonbeam!\u201d Trump collectively trashed his whole lineage of predecessors, suggesting he was the first American president not to be a \u201cpatsy\u201d and a \u201cpushover\u201d to foreign interests.", "Many members of the news media covered the rally, even as their colleagues assembled in Washington, D.C., for the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner, which Trump ostentatiously spurned in favor of his down-home event. Here are some examples of how these reporters characterized Trump\u2019s speech in the leads of their news stories: President Donald Trump took aim at familiar political targets and added a few fresh ones during a campaign-style rally Saturday night in an Upper Midwest state that gave him a surprising victory in the 2016 election. (Associated Press, April 28, 2018) Since Macomb County helped deliver the presidency to Donald Trump, he decided to return the favor Saturday night. He came to Washington Township in Michigan to tout his record since being inaugurated in 2017 and urge a huge crowd at the Total Sports Park arena to get to the polls in November to elect Republicans. (USA Today, April 29, 2018) President Trump capped a volatile week of progress and setbacks with a long, angry blast at Democrats, the news media, immigration laws and other favorite adversaries on Saturday night as he sought to reinforce his position as a Washington outsider victimized by a system threatened by him. (New York Times, April 28, 2018)", "President Donald Trump took aim at familiar political targets and added a few fresh ones during a campaign-style rally Saturday night in an Upper Midwest state that gave him a surprising victory in the 2016 election.

(New York Times, April 28, 2018)", "While many news stories were blunt about Trump\u2019s aggressive tone and wandering focus, they also were matter-of-fact about his belligerence, invective, and false statements. No mainstream news story I reviewed suggested that veiled threats of blackmail, embrace of tyrants, repudiation of former presidents, personal insults against former subordinates, and fabrication of numbers and events was abnormal or inappropriate behavior for a head of state of a major government, let alone for the democratically elected president of a nation that has long asserted itself as the world\u2019s moral leader.", "The purpose of this study is to illuminate and contrast two approaches to covering the style of political communication exemplified by Trump: the dominant, traditional approach evident in the coverage above, and an alternative approach that places Trump\u2019s statements in immediate factual, historical, and affective context. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we may refer to the dominant approach as the \u201cobjectivity paradigm\u201d (e.g. McDevitt and Ferrucci 2017; Steiner 2018): the embrace of longstanding journalistic norms such as detachment, nonpartisanship, facticity, the inverted pyramid, and balance (Mindich 1998), under which reporters are forbidden to reveal their point of view or to cast doubt on a source\u2019s authority without appealing to a contravening source. The alternative approach exemplified in this study, while not altogether abandoning certain tenets of objectivity, prioritizes an authoritative form of informed assertion based on the reporter\u2019s observations, experience, and contextual knowledge \u2013 often privileging these over simply representing the source\u2019s message and agenda in stenographic fashion. To contrast these approaches, I closely analyze live Twitter feeds from two reporters who covered Trump\u2019s April 28, 2018, rally: Paul Egan of the Detroit Free Press, representing the dominant approach, and Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star, representing an alternative.", "Dale\u2019s reporting denormalizes and demystifies Trump\u2019s rhetorical tactics by exposing them to instantaneous critique rather than tacitly endorsing them through bare repetition, and by making full use of the Aristotelian tools of logos, ethos, and pathos (Grabe and Zhou 2003) \u2013 blending factual argument with emotional appeals to make a personal connection with his audience (Cloud 2018). Dale\u2019s practices overtly place Trump\u2019s abnormal speech in the realm of \u201ccarnival\u201d \u2013 Mikhail Bakhtin\u2019s concept of a \u201csecond\u201d social world in which parody, debasement, and folk laughter invert the official, everyday \u201cfirst\u201d world of serious living. I argue that the dominant objectivity paradigm \u00ad\u2013 through which Trump\u2019s carnivalesque tactics are represented as normal \u201cfirst world\u201d politics through coherent summaries and elision of Trump\u2019s wildest claims \u00ad\u2013 offers less civically useful framing than approaches highlighting the \u201csecond world,\u201d parodic inversion endemic to Trump\u2019s public performances. In a thread brimming with context, background knowledge, bluntness, humor, and occasional bewilderment, Dale demonstrates in a barrage of 280-character dispatches that one can more effectively capture the experience of the Trump presidency by transcending entrenched objectivity and the perceived obligation to make more sense than one\u2019s sources. Comparing Dale\u2019s approach to the dominant frame renders unnatural the reporting style generally accepted as common sense and generates possibilities for rethinking contemporary reporting that could disrupt the existentially toxic political environment in the US and many Western democracies."]}, {"title": "Bakhtin, Carnival, and Trump", "paragraphs": ["Mikhail Bakhtin was a twentieth century Russian philosopher, ethicist, and literary theorist writing under repressive conditions. His concept of carnival offers a critical framework for theorizing Trump\u2019s brand of political communication and his supporters\u2019 performative responses (Hall, Goldstein, and Ingram 2016; Gaufman 2018). Bakhtin (1994) writes of \u201ctwo worlds\u201d of cultural interaction derived from the writer Rebalais\u2019 portrayal of medieval social life: the official \u201cfirst world\u201d of ritual, pageantry, and formal statecraft, where the serious business of life is managed, and the extended events of carnival, a \u201csecond world\u201d of unofficial folk entertainment and humor, where everyone participates and the mighty are both celebrated and ridiculed through profanity, flattened social hierarchies, and privileging of the body and the grotesque. Carnival is conceived as an outlet for marginalized or subaltern peoples to participate in social critique and achieve social renewal without upsetting the formal order (Gaufman 2018); it is \u201cnot a spectacle seen by the people; they live in it\u201d (Bakhtin 1994, 198). Such spectacle includes \u201cprofanities and oaths\u2009\u2026\u2009excluded from the sphere of official speech because they broke its norms.\u2009\u2026\u2009Here in the carnival atmosphere they acquired the nature of laughter and became ambivalent\u201d (Bakhtin 1994, 204).", "The carnival concept has been applied in contemporary American media culture through the satire and parody of such entertainments as The Colbert Report and Saturday Night Live, on which political figures often appear both as themselves and through impersonators (Druick 2009; Meddaugh 2010) and The Onion newspaper, which critiques cultural norms through hyperbolized performance of news media conventions (Achter 2008). These carnivalesque expressions invoke laughter through mocking and rendering grotesque official and serious \u201cfirst world\u201d institutions such as government and the news media. Carnival, which historically occurred for about a quarter of each year in pre-Protestant medieval societies (Druick 2009) is conceived as a temporary subversion of the official world by this grotesque, profane, egalitarian and multivocal celebration, much as contemporary comedy shows and publications provide a second-world respite from the day\u2019s official news and events.", "Donald Trump, however, upsets this balance: In his public communication such as rallies, speeches, and tweets, he has collapsed these two worlds, merging the carnivalesque with official life (Jamieson and Taussig 2017; Kellner 2018). Trump invites his followers to play along in debasing themselves, the news media, political opponents, and the very institutions for which he is responsible, while simultaneously occupying a formal role as head of state, the \u201cleader of the free world.\u201d An example of this imposition of carnival performance on official first-world duty was Trump\u2019s 2018 speech to the United Nations, where his hyperbolic claim to have accomplished more than any previous administration \u2013 the type of claim often reported with a straight face in US news media \u2013 was greeted by spontaneous laughter from the world leaders witnessing the speech (USA Today, September 25, 2018). Trump, thus, is both the fool and the king, breaking down the typical hierarchies between a president and everyday citizens in a way that allows certain people who feel socially insecure \u2013 the white majority that nevertheless self-identifies as subaltern (Gaufman 2018) \u2013 to embody his power. One illustration is a video in which a white Trump supporter, attempting to intimidate a black man on a public square, not only uses racial epithets but also asserts, \u201cI run this country.\u2009\u2026\u2009I\u2019m the president\u201d (NowThis 2018). The profanity of carnival is evident in the administration\u2019s characterizations of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, including the \u201c\u2019Fuck Obama\u2019 Doctrine\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re America, Bitch\u201d (The Atlantic, June 11, 2018). It should be noted that even in the equalizing world of carnival, society\u2019s most marginalized groups \u2013 the true subaltern \u2013 remain the prime targets for abuse and ridicule (Gaufman 2018).", "Rhetorical theory suggests that words are not just inert symbols that communicate denotative meaning; their utterance constitutes \u201cspeech acts\u201d that make things happen in the world (Parks and Takahashi 2016; Goodwin 2018), and communicators take on corresponding ethical commitments to their audiences. The two approaches to covering Trump\u2019s carnivalesque rhetoric under study here make different things happen and suggest different ethical commitments. The \u201cobjective\u201d approach, featuring formal nods to neutrality such as the inverted pyramid structure and non-evaluative reproductions of Trump\u2019s claims (Mindich 1998; Kovach and Rosenstiel 2014), help to render those claims legitimate products of first-world, official common-sense. They signal to audiences that Trump, while perhaps colorful, is coloring within the lines of normal politics rather than blurring those lines and co-mingling the official world with the grotesque, non-serious world of carnival. Such \u201cobjective\u201d coverage of this style of communication does not serve the general public but rather \u201cserves dominant groups that don\u2019t play fair\u201d (Steiner 2018, 1855) and in normalizing carnivalesque inversion \u201ccan have disastrous consequences for a political community\u201d (Gaufman 2018, 3).", "Dale\u2019s approach, on the other hand, produces speech acts that bring the carnivalesque nature of Trump\u2019s rhetoric into clear relief. Dale denaturalizes Trump\u2019s lies and insults, thereby activating many readers\u2019 critical faculties and offering citizens who aren\u2019t constrained by partisan blinders an opportunity to recognize the threats that carnivalesque governance poses to democratic processes. The present study details how the traditional objectivity paradigm necessitates speech acts that normalize Trump\u2019s rhetoric, and how Dale\u2019s hybrid approach \u2013 favoring the objective paradigm\u2019s emphasis on verification (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2014) but allowing for a subjective incorporation of pathos that lends authenticity and urgency to the verification process \u2013 offers a \u201cthird way\u201d of representing Trump\u2019s speech between the banal stenography that validates it and either the policy advocacy of punditry or the comedic satire that dismisses its serious repercussions."]}, {"title": "Trump Deconstructs \u2013 Media Framing Reconstructs", "paragraphs": ["A fascinating aspect of Trump\u2019s public communication is the carnivalesque ambivalence of his messaging: He not only deploys explosive, divisive, grotesque and profane rhetoric (Jamieson and Taussig 2017; Wahl-Jorgensen 2018), but he often transparently deconstructs this rhetoric for both reporters and supporters. He reportedly told an associate that he was deliberately labeling an FBI informant who had monitored his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia as a spy, \u201cbelieving the more nefarious term would resonate more in the media and with the public\u201d (Associated Press, May 23, 2018). Trump told a reporter during the 2016 campaign that he attacked the press \u201c\u2018to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you\u2019\u201d (\u201cLesley Stahl\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d 2018). Trump leveled with his voters at post-election rallies about his manipulation tactics, noting that the \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d chant from the campaign \u201cplays great before the election. Now we don\u2019t care\u201d (Huffington Post, December 9, 2016) and almost ridiculing their frenzied carnival behavior: \u201cYou people were vicious, violent, screaming, \u2018Where's the wall? We want the wall!\u2019 Screaming, \u2018Prison! Prison! Lock her up!\u2019 I mean you are going crazy\u201d (CNN, December 17, 2016). Reading from a speech to abortion opponents, Trump began telling supporters their 2018 votes were as important as their 2016 votes \u2013 then, perhaps reflecting that he wasn\u2019t on the 2018 ballot, ad-libbed: \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure I really believe that, but you know. I don\u2019t know who the hell wrote that line, I\u2019m not sure. But it\u2019s still important, remember\u201d (Washington Post, May 23, 2018). Shortly after crowing about his achievements at the June 2018 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump explained how he would react if his lofty goals deflated: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever admit that I was wrong. I\u2019ll find some kind of an excuse\u201d (Raleigh 2018).", "At the same time Trump waxes candidly about his rhetorical means and ends, he is a prolific presidential liar (Leonhardt and Thompson 2017). News organizations tracking his falsehoods have reported that he uttered thousands of fabrications in his campaign and early presidency (e.g. Washington Post, June 1, 2018), prompting no small amount of hand-wringing among journalists as to how to characterize his fallacies (Weiss 2016; Barry 2017; Greenberg 2017; Milbank 2018).", "This behavior has all been reported; mainstream media sources account for most of the examples cited above. But the episodes are generally offered as brites, asides, post-hoc analyses (e.g. Qiu 2018; Westwood 2018), or bits of color (Heidt 2018), rather than the central operating principle of Trump\u2019s character or presidency. For instance, Trump\u2019s laughter-evoking boast in his 2018 UN speech cited above was a brief sidebar in the USA Today\u2019s reporting, compared with a main story published nearly an hour earlier that portrayed Trump as expressing a coherent and resolute world view: \u201cPresident Donald Trump blamed Iranian leaders for sowing \u2018chaos, death and destruction\u2019 in a steely speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that heavily emphasized the president's support of national sovereignty over globalism\u201d (Fritze and Shesgreen 2018).", "In this fashion, the US news media\u2019s overriding practice has been to reconstruct what Trump tears apart, to produce a smoothed over version that presents Trump as undifferentiated from previous presidents. Lesley Stahl, for instance, apparently saved her anecdote about Trump\u2019s motives for attacking the press until the second year of his presidency. Politico (June 1, 2018) noted how Trump would blast the news media on the record \u2013 rhetoric that was dutifully reported \u2013 then go off the record to speak informally with the reporters he publicly distrusts and despises. Such revelations about Trump\u2019s statements typically take a back seat to the empirically dubious content of those statements. Just two days after Trump was reported saying he would make up excuses if the North Korea summit failed, the New York Times (June 13, 2018) published a story based solely on Trump\u2019s early-morning tweets: \u201cPresident Trump returned to the United States early on Wednesday praising his diplomatic prowess after his meeting with the North Korean leader and declaring, \u2018There is no longer a nuclear threat\u2019 from Pyongyang.\u201d", "Rendering Trump\u2019s statements \u2013 however false, self-serving, profane, or unrealistic \u2013 as official presidential pronouncements bearing the legitimacy of the office is a deliberate framing choice, not an inevitable journalistic practice. \u201cTo frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text\u201d (Entman 1993, 52, emphasis in original). In the dominant objectivity paradigm, Trump\u2019s surface claims, rather than the bizarre and grotesque context of those claims, are often presented as the most salient aspects of his rhetoric. It\u2019s not that journalistic resources aren\u2019t used to correct Trump\u2019s falsehoods; it\u2019s that traditionally framed news accounts of Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u2013 routine coverage of speeches, rallies, and other events \u00ad\u2013 proceed as though this ample critical reporting did not exist. Mainstream reporters occasionally call attention to this dominant reporting frame, as when the Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler (2018) observed his colleagues simply picking up Trump falsehoods from an interview: Trump keeps repeating stuff that's been previously fact checked. There should be no excuse for a reporter to quote from his Fox and Friends interview without noting his factual errors.Reporters appeared to confront Trump more aggressively as he repeatedly blamed Democrats for his policy of separating immigrant children from parents at the border (Stelter 2018). Some scholars (e.g. Rosen 2018) took such efforts as a sign that journalists were reconsidering their dominant frame for covering Trump statements. But an alternative model for framing Trump\u2019s rhetoric had already existed in Toronto Star Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Dale. In the analysis below, I compare Dale\u2019s frame orientation of deconstructing Trump using the full rhetorical arsenal of logos, ethos, and pathos against the dominant approach of reconstructing Trump\u2019s carnivalesque rhetoric as official speech. Dale\u2019s deconstructions provide a style of journalism that addresses Trump and his supporters\u2019 politics of \u201cnorm-shattering rhetoric\u201d (Jamieson and Taussig 2017) characterized by strategically anti-rational, anti-empirical, and anti-civil communication that speaks to followers through code and confounds good-faith deliberation through contradiction and obfuscation. By highlighting a journalistic approach that spotlights the norm-shattering rather than attempting to make sense of it, I hope to make such practice more salient for researchers and journalists, thus nudging scholarship and practice toward more contextual and holistic approaches to post-normative political actors.", "Trump keeps repeating stuff that's been previously fact checked. There should be no excuse for a reporter to quote from his Fox and Friends interview without noting his factual errors."]}, {"title": "Method", "paragraphs": ["This study was inspired by a Daniel Dale tweet on Trump\u2019s April 28, 2018, rally in Michigan. During one incoherent moment, Dale stopped trying to represent what Trump was saying in mid-tweet and wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t even understand.\u201d I retweeted that post, noting how rarely journalists indicate that a major politician is being unclear or indecipherable rather than trying to impose some order and logic onto their statements. The observation inspired me to compare Dale\u2019s live Twitter reporting on the event with other coverage to analyze how his commentary departed from standard journalistic framing and could point the way to a journalistic approach equipped to meet Trump\u2019s carnivalesque regime. Analyzing text in its cultural context offers unique insight into \u201cthe ideological potential\u2009\u2026\u2009between production and consumption,\u201d with a focus not on \u201chow accurately does the text reflect reality but what version of reality is normalized and as a consequence, how emancipatory or hegemonic is the text\u201d (F\u00fcrsich 2009, 249, emphasis in original). Close analysis of relatively small textual samples enables a depth and nuance of insight that brute methods of higher-volume analysis can overlook (Parks 2019).", "I captured Dale\u2019s tweets after the rally both by manually copying the link to his coverage thread and by launching a search for relevant tweets through analysis software DiscoverText. For a comparison thread from the dominant reporting frame, I performed a Google search for other news organizations that covered the event and looked to reporters\u2019 Twitter feeds for whether they had also live tweeted. I did not find a thread as meticulous or extensive as Dale\u2019s, but one voluminous live feed was tweeted by Paul Egan from the Detroit Free Press, a regional newspaper near the rally. I preserved Egan\u2019s tweets by both manually copying and pasting individual unthreaded tweets into a notes file and creating a data stream in DiscoverText. I used Dale and Egan\u2019s Twitter threads and a C-SPAN video of the rally with a running transcript to identify points in Trump\u2019s speech where either Egan or Dale had made a Twitter reference. From these three sources \u2013 the transcripted Trump statements and the two reporters\u2019 live-tweets, I compiled a table to show when each reporter tweeted and how he characterized Trump\u2019s comments. This arrangement allowed a comparison of which aspects of Trump\u2019s speech each reporter chose to highlight and, in cases where the reporters noted the same comments, a comparison of how each reporter presented those comments. For efficiency in managing the text of Trump\u2019s 78-minute speech, I personally transcribed not the full speech but the portions that either Egan or Dale tweeted about, usually including additional contextual statements surrounding whatever quote(s) the reporters highlighted in their tweets. Egan\u2019s (35) and Dale\u2019s (60) relevant tweets combined for a total of 85 rows for analysis. Some rows contain only Egan tweets, particularly a series of pre-rally posts leading up to Trump\u2019s speech; many rows contain only tweets from Dale, who tweeted nearly three times as often from the actual speech as Egan did; and a handful of rows consist of tweets from both reporters addressing the same passage of Trump\u2019s text.", "After transcribing and arranging statements and tweets across columns, I created a new column for analytical notes and examined each row to discern the characteristics of each reporter\u2019s tweets. I first noted whether tweets uncritically quoted or paraphrased Trump or if they critiqued his assertions. I was particularly interested in analytical points where both reporters tweeted from the same Trump statement, but this occurred less often than expected. In addition to noting cases of critical vs. uncritical tweets, I also read for patterns in the types of statements the reporters picked up for tweeting and for the cumulative frame each reporter constructed from his body of tweets through choices of which topics and commentary to make salient. I compared the overall tone and content of the Twitter feeds not just against each other but with a purposive sample of mainstream news stories from the rally, including posts from national news organizations such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Associated Press. I also compared the tweets against stories for the Detroit Free Press and USA Today (both owned by Gannett) that Egan contributed bylines to. I did not find a narrative text story about the rally by Dale. It\u2019s possible Dale\u2019s live tweeting of the event was more complete than Egan\u2019s because Dale used the format as his sole reporting platform.1"]}, {"title": "Results and Discussion", "paragraphs": ["Trump\u2019s April 28, 2018, speech recapitulated the carnivalesque rhetorical tropes and self-deconstructions described in the first half of this paper. As the introduction notes, Trump contrasted his appearance in Michigan with the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner he had spurned in Washington, D.C. He voluminously belittled and mocked his enemies in politics, government, and the press, such as calling California\u2019s governor \u201cMoonbeam.\u201d He praised U.S. ideological adversaries such as the authoritarian leader of China, while deriding traditional allies such as democratic trading partners. He set himself and his accomplishments above all predecessors and competitors. He moved from topic to topic seemingly through free association, rather than following a logical progression of points. He uttered multiple empirical falsehoods. He devoted a chunk of the speech, more than a year into his presidency, to a lengthy reminiscence of his Election Night surprise. He performed, in short, a post-normative political display: framing everything in relation to himself, embracing only his loyal followers, undermining the historical gravitas of the presidency, delegitimizing democratic institutions such as a free press and federal law enforcement, and reversing the poles on modern U.S. global alliances.", "Yet, as noted above, the dominant mainstream framing of Trump\u2019s rally was to summarize his speech through a traditional, official, \u201cfirst world\u201d orientation, with inverted-pyramid style that lent the performance a veneer of normalized presidential coherence and a selection of quotes and paraphrases assembled in logical order with narrative transitions. CNN\u2019s lead, for instance, was: \u201cPresident Donald Trump criticized Democrats and the media and touted what he described as his accomplishments in office during a campaign-style rally in Michigan on Saturday\u201d (Foran 2018). The story notes how Trump \u201cattacked Democratic Sens. John Tester of Montana and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan,\u2009\u2026\u2009talked up his domestic agenda and laid out a potential timeline for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\u201d It adds that \u201cTrump made promises to the Michigan crowd that echoed his 2016 campaign,\u201d such as \u201c\u2019straightening out\u2019 what he referred to as \u2018disastrous trade deals.\u2019\u201d The story does not distinguish between when Trump appears to be reading from his script and when he is ad-libbing, nor does it distinguish between when he appears to be telling the truth and when he is making things up. The Washington Post lead reads, \u201cPresident Trump bragged about his economic and diplomatic accomplishments and savaged the media during a raucous rally Saturday before thousands of supporters in a state that is critical to his reelection hopes\u201d (Chason and Lynch 2018). The story notes that the speech was long and \u201crambling,\u201d lists the range of topics covered \u2013 \u201cnods to space travel, the price of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, promises of \u2018crystal clean water,\u2019 entertainer Kanye West and plans to rehabilitate local infrastructure\u201d \u2013 a subtle acknowledgement of Trump\u2019s carnivalesque rhetorical sprawl \u2013 and contextualizes some of Trump\u2019s economic claims with federal labor data. But the story avoids Trump\u2019s most outrageous statements, threats, and open mockery listed at the beginning of this paper and does little to challenge his economic and diplomatic optimism. Note, for instance, that while the Post lead contains the strong verbs \u201cbragged\u201d and \u201csavaged,\u201d both the formal summative structure and the platitudinous context of \u201ca raucous rally\u2009\u2026\u2009in a state that is critical to his re-election hopes\u201d serve to legitimize Trump\u2019s rhetoric as normal, \u201cfirst-world\u201d politics. The USA Today, picking up reporting from its Detroit Free Press staffers, features this sentence: \u201cTrump spoke to a crowd that filled about two-thirds of the arena and they showed their support with cheers, MAGA hats and T-shirts bearing his name and likeness\u201d (Gray, Siacon, and Egan 2018a), a descriptive representation of the multivocal carnival crowd. But despite the reporters\u2019 observation that the arena was not at capacity, the story ignores Trump\u2019s false claim that five times as many people were waiting outside.", "Michigan media followed a pattern similar to national reports, but also emphasized attending state politicians and Trump\u2019s promise to fix the aging Soo Locks facilitating shipping in the upper Great Lakes. The Detroit Free Press story, by the same reporters who filed for USA Today, includes several paragraphs on the locks, noting that \u201c[Trump] said he might even call the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers about the project Saturday night, though it might not happen until Sunday\u201d (Gray, Siacon, and Egan 2018b). Such credulous reproduction of this extemporaneous claim is an example of \u201cofficializing\u201d Trump\u2019s carnival speech. Meanwhile, a fawning report by statewide media group MLive summarized the speech this way: \u201cIn comments that ranged from reminiscing about winning Michigan and other Midwestern states in the 2016 presidential election to policy issues such as immigration and relations with foreign countries, Trump remained fully confident that he was taking the country in the right direction\u201d (Gibbons 2018).", "The tweets of the Free Press\u2019s Paul Egan and of the Toronto Star\u2019s Daniel Dale offer a different temporal perspective on Trump\u2019s rally from the summative news stories. Produced in real time, they present a more staccato impression of Trump\u2019s performance and reproduce it in largely chronological order. The Twitter platform allows for instantaneous observations and commentary that might not make it into a narrative news story. But within the medium\u2019s affordances and constraints, Egan and Dale took remarkably different approaches to framing Trump\u2019s rhetoric.2 Egan tweeted only about half as many times as Dale, and did more work setting up the event with pre-reported contextual tweets ahead of the talk. Dale did not start tweeting until Trump started speaking, and he was more prolific in capturing the bulk of Trump\u2019s utterances. But Dale did not simply report Trump\u2019s statements; he critically evaluated them with occasional personal expressions, making salient the carnivalesque nature of the event rather than superimposing an everyday, normalized frame on Trump\u2019s assertions.", "The first of Paul Egan\u2019s 35 rally-related tweets comes about an hour before Trump speaks, when he previews coverage by his Free Press colleague Kathleen Gray and announces he\u2019ll be livetweeting from a livestream. Egan devotes 17 tweets \u2013 nearly half \u2013 to pre-rally color and context, with local-interest information including rally-related traffic tie-ups and details about the arena, which he notes \u201cholds about 5,000 ppl indoors per fire regulations, but thousands more could watch on giant monitor from nearby soccer fields.\u201d Egan also provides background on Trump\u2019s 2016 margin of victory in the host county and state Republican candidates\u2019 relations with Trump.", "Egan\u2019s first Trump quote comes at the top of the speech, when Trump says, \u201cYou may have heard I was invited to another event tonight, the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. But I\u2019d much rather be in Washington, Michigan, than in Washington, D.C. right now. That I can tell you.\u201d Egan quotes, \u201cI\u2019d much rather be in Washington, Michigan, than in Washington, D.C.\u201d Two minutes into the speech, Egan notes Trump\u2019s \u201cshout-out\u201d to Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a gubernatorial candidate and Trump booster. Egan also captures Trump\u2019s casual carnivalesque profanity by noting that Trump muttered \u201cwherever the hell he is\u201d when he couldn\u2019t find Schuette in the audience. About three minutes in, Egan notes Trump\u2019s praise of Michigan native Ronna Romney McDaniel, then chair of the Republican National Committee. Egan\u2019s subsequent tweets are sporadic, often lapsing up to five or 10 min between posts. His first tweet on the substance of Trump\u2019s speech is summary: \u201c#Trump is hitting on many of his 2016 campaign themes: Immigration, the need for strong borders, strong military and a border wall, praise for law enforcement, attacking Dems and \u2018sanctuary cities.\u2019\u201d Seven minutes later, Egan quotes Trump on diplomacy: \u201cThe denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, North Korea\u2009\u2026\u2009we\u2019ll see how it goes. Whatever happens happens\u2009\u2026\u2009I think we'll do fine.\u201d The phrase elided by Egan\u2019s first ellipses is Trump interrupting himself to chant, \u201cDe-nuke. De-Nuke!\u201d By reducing Trump\u2019s statement to his bare message, while skipping over his strange verbal prancing, Egan\u2019s tweet renders the statement presidential and official, instead of performative and carnivalesque.", "Egan\u2019s next tweet, with no context, quotes Trump\u2019s threat toward Montana Sen. John Tester, who had raised concerns about short-lived Veterans Affairs appointee Ronny Jackson: \u201c#Trump: \u2018I know things about Tester that I could say too, and if I said them, he\u2019d never be elected again.\u2019\u201d About 25 min into Trump\u2019s speech, Egan picks up on Trump\u2019s Michigan reference: \u201c#Trump: \u2018For too long the loyalty of Michigan workers was repaid with pure and simple betrayal.\u2019\u201d At 27 min, Egan quotes Trump saying he blames past presidents, not foreign countries, for historically \u201ctak[ing] advantage\u201d of the United States, then four minutes later he quotes Trump saying, \u201cGuess what? Not happening any more, folks. It's not happening.\u201d At 33 min, Trump brings up the Soo Locks, suggesting he learned about them from a Michigan member of Congress in the car on the way to the venue. Egan tweets, \u201c#Trump now pledges to upgrade the Soo Locks \u2013 something Gov. Rick #Snyder and other state leaders have been pushing for.\u201d About 55 min in, Egan notes Trump\u2019s pivot to \u201crecalling his last rally of the 2016 campaign, in Grand Rapids MI, which went into the early morning hours of Election Day.\u201d Egan returns about 10 min later, when Trump reprises his Soo Locks interest and then reinforces his local connection; Egan quotes him saying: \u201cWe're going to stand up for places like #Detroit that need help\u2009\u2026\u2009and we're going to stand up for great states like Michigan.\u201d Egan does not tweet for the last 12 min of Trump\u2019s speech, concluding with \u201c#Trump wraps up his Michigan rally with \u2018I accomplished more than I promised and I'm doing it for you,\u2019 then \u2018We will #MAGA.\u2019 He spoke for about 80 minutes.\u201d Egan\u2019s last tweet, post-speech, links to the Free Press roundup story.", "The most noteworthy characteristic of Egan\u2019s live tweets is how little they differ from the traditional framing of presidential speech coverage exemplified in the text stories described above. Egan could have been reporting nearly any speech from nearly any politician, so routine, detached, and matter-of-fact is his recounting. His dispatches summarize, localize, and represent the speaker\u2019s comments \u2013 focusing salience on the surface-level claims without imposing a response, judgment, or wider context onto them. His speech act emphasizes the ethos in Aristotle\u2019s rhetorical triumvirate (Grabe and Zhou 2003): It seeks audience support by establishing the reporter\u2019s credibility as a neutral observer, with the effect of presenting Trump\u2019s rhetoric as undifferentiated from his predecessors\u2019. In the next section, I show how the Toronto Star\u2019s Daniel Dale makes clear as a matter of practice that Trump\u2019s speech is anything but normal; that it is, in fact, a performance that veers wildly from accepted US democratic and presidential traditions. Dale\u2019s alternative framing foregrounds how Trump\u2019s performance exists in the world of carnival.", "Dale reported on many Trump events in 2018. Unlike the dominant framing approach, which tends to take Trump at his word when initially reporting statements and only later or less prominently to \u201cfact-check\u201d or contextualize Trump\u2019s claims (e.g. Qiu 2018), Dale has relentlessly watchdogged Trump\u2019s utterances. Dale does not just fact-check in real time: He expresses indignance, impatience, and confusion in real-time as well. Rather than tying up a Trump performance in a presidential package with a legitimizing bow, Dale\u2019s approach makes salient the anti-normative and grotesque aspects of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. For instance, Dale highlights Trump\u2019s self-deconstructions rather than leaving them in the background. While commenting on one Trump speech, he tweeted, \u201cIt is always wild when Trump is boringly reading a boring script and then flips the switch to Actual Trump\u201d (Dale 2018a), signaling to readers the difference between words put into Trump\u2019s mouth by staff and words that pour out of his own brain.", "In another thread comparing his reporting with the dominant approach, Dale observes: I can\u2019t even tell you the number of times I\u2019ve covered a rally where Trump has said more than 15 false things and then read stories on the rally that didn\u2019t once mention this incessant dishonesty. It\u2019s \u201cTrump talks up tax plan\u201d or \u201cTrump attacks such and such.\u201d (Dale 2018b).In the same thread, Dale argues that whether Trump\u2019s falsehoods are called \u201clies\u201d or something else is not as important as \u201ccoverage frequency and intensity\u201d \u2013 being willing to treat the dissembling as \u201ca central daily story of this presidency.\u201d", "I can\u2019t even tell you the number of times I\u2019ve covered a rally where Trump has said more than 15 false things and then read stories on the rally that didn\u2019t once mention this incessant dishonesty. It\u2019s \u201cTrump talks up tax plan\u201d or \u201cTrump attacks such and such.\u201d (Dale 2018b).", "Dale constructs this frame by calling Trump out statement by statement while live-tweeting a speech. In one thread, Dale (2018c) actually narrates Trump \u201cformulating a lie in real time,\u201d showing how he changed a scripted detail from the fact that criminal gang MS-13 had called for killing police on Long Island to the false statement that they had actually done so. Dale added that \u201cthe president inventing a cop-killing - got no coverage outside of Twitter, as far as I can tell from the internet.\u201d", "Dale has also applied this framing strategy to his follow-up stories for the Star, arguing that a traditionally formatted article cannot capture Trump\u2019s \u201cunhingedness\u201d as effectively as simply listing a series of his statements, which Dale did under the headline \u201cMinute by minute: Trump\u2019s wildly dishonest rally speech in Nashville\u201d (Dale 2018d). Contrast this approach with the dominant approach of artificially reconstructing Trump\u2019s deconstructions from the same event, such as the Washington Post\u2019s (May 30, 2018) summative headline, \u201cTrump ties Republican midterm strategy to immigration, claims Mexico will pay for border wall.\u201d", "On the night of the April 28, 2018, Michigan rally, Dale began live-tweeting as Trump began speaking, seizing on the same quote as Egan about Trump\u2019s preference for Washington Township over Washington, D.C. Overall, Dale, who does not appear to have written a wrap-up story of the rally, tweeted much more comprehensively than Egan. While Dale\u2019s first tweet matches the observation and tone of Egan\u2019s, the two reporters quickly diverge in their approach. To begin, Dale does not simply report Trump\u2019s claim that five times as many people are outside the rally as inside; he tweets, \u201cAny reporters on the scene?\u201d in an attempt to crowdsource and verify the claim in real time. (A follower then snidely asks if a Trump crowd claim has ever been accurate, and Dale responds, \u201cno, but i can't assume.\u201d)", "Before fully engaging his alternative frame, Dale quotes a couple of early Trump platitudes without critique: First, \u201cWe support the rule of law, and we support the heroes of law enforcement\u201d and then, \u201cWe honour our flag. And if others honoured our flag, they'd be a lot better off.\u201d But about six minutes into the speech, Dale diverges from Egan\u2019s credulous coverage style and adopts a more critical and authoritative frame. Dale\u2019s alternative reporting is marked by three key strategies, corresponding to the rhetorical tools of logos, ethos, and pathos. First, Dale spotlights unpresidential, carnivalesque utterances such as name-calling and bizarre syntax by calling attention to their irrational nature, fulfilling the role of logos in enforcing \u201c[c]onsistency in the logic of the message and supporting evidence\u201d (Grabe and Zhou 2003, 316). Second, Dale identifies and tracks lies in real time by drawing on his past reporting, thereby establishing an ethos of disciplinary credibility that surpasses mere stenographic accuracy while simultaneously highlighting Trump\u2019s dubious ethos. Third, Dale deconstructs Trump\u2019s discursive and rhetorical moves, in part by sharing his own confusion or disbelief \u2013 an appeal to pathos, or emotional connection with the audience, that most news reporting lacks (Parks, in press).", "Together, these strategies applied to live news reporting make salient the non-normative and often anti-democratic nature of Trump\u2019s political communication.", "Dale appeals to logos by spotlighting Trump\u2019s irrational, illogical claims. On immigration, for instance, Dale quotes Trump and in the same tweet contradicts him: \u201cSan Diego, they're being just overrun\u2009\u2026\u2009overrun by people pouring. So they're begging us for a wall.\u201d San Diego is not begging for a wall. Trump then falsely says the wall has been \u201cstarted in San Diego.\u201d Only prototypes have been built there.Just short of the eight-minute mark, when Egan summarizes Trump\u2019s policy topics, Dale notes what Egan does not: that Trump had just called the governor of California \u201cMoonbeam.\u201d In the actual speech, Trump delights in the nickname, saying it once as a sentence unto itself: \u201cMoonbeam,\u201d and then repeating it louder, with apparent joy: \u201cMoonbeam!\u201d Nicknames are a hallmark of carnival (Gaufman 2018); they \u201cconnect the subject to the grotesque body, thus becoming comic\u2009\u2026\u2009By mocking the subject and making the named person look foolish, nicknames give special power to the provider\u201d (Hall, Goldstein, and Ingram 2016, 86). But this carnival speech, reported by Dale, went unreported in most mainstream news stories and in Egan\u2019s livetweet. Dale reprises this kind of pickup \u2013 spotlighting Trump\u2019s bizarre name-calling and diversions \u2013 when he notes in the 24th minute: \u201cTrump is on an extended rant against Comey, the \u2018two lovers\u2019 at the FBI, and Andrew McCabe. He falsely says again that Andrew McCabe took $700,000. He references the pathological liar character Jon Lovitz once played on Saturday Night Live.\u201d When Trump speaks of the Chinese leader, Dale tweets, \u201cTrump with some admiration: \u2018I looked at President Xi, and he's the BOSS. He's the guy.\u2019\u201d Dale points out when \u201cTrump brings back one of his weirdest false claims, saying he was named Michigan's \u2018Republican of the Year\u2019 even before he was running. He used to claim he was named Michigan Man of the Year, period, which is not a thing.\u201d Dale reports and contextualizes another Trump standby: \u201cTrump is getting even more detailed in his almost certainly fictional story about how he almost signed a plan to spend $1 billion on a new Jerusalem embassy and then stopped.\u201d Dale shows how Trump deploys celebrity allies to create the sheen of a diverse support base: \u201cTrump: \u2018Kanye West gets it. He gets it. He gets it.\u2019\u201d Dale captures Trump\u2019s grotesque flippancy regarding his ominous military power: \u201cTrump on a military strike: \u2018Look at what happened in Syria: boom, boom, BING.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cSan Diego, they're being just overrun\u2009\u2026\u2009overrun by people pouring. So they're begging us for a wall.\u201d San Diego is not begging for a wall. Trump then falsely says the wall has been \u201cstarted in San Diego.\u201d Only prototypes have been built there.", "Dale demonstrates extraordinary rigor in keeping track of Trump\u2019s fictions \u2013 not merely pointing them out but documenting each case of a repeated falsehood \u2013 thus building credibility with his audience for each new claim while documenting Trump\u2019s own troubled ethos. During a late-speech passage in which Trump reminisces about his final pre-election rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Free Press\u2019s Egan captures Trump\u2019s nostalgia: \u201c\u2018We had a great time,\u2019 he says, and it was evident \u2018we're going to win Michigan.\u2019\u201d Dale\u2019s tweet, alternatively, captures Trump\u2019s grasping exaggeration: \u201cTrump twice says he had 32,000 people at his election-eve rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The hall had a capacity of 4,200. Local media estimated 8,000 total including people stuck outside.\u201d Also near the end, when Trump speaks on health care, Dale tweets: \u201cTrump, boasting about eliminating the individual mandate, on Obamacare: \u2018Some people would say essentially we've gotten rid of it.\u2019 If anyone says that, they are not correct!\u201d In the sixteenth minute, when Egan tweets that Trump expects to \u201cdo fine\u201d with North Korea, Dale picks a different quote in which Trump alludes to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal: Trump on dealing with North Korea: \u201cI may go in, it may not work out, I leave. I'm not going to be a John Kerry.\u201d For the 10th time in office, he falsely says the Obama administration gave Iran $150 billion.When Trump inflates the US trade deficit with China, Dale tweets, \u201cThat is the 30th time in office he has given an inaccurate figure for the China trade deficit. It is $337 billion.\u201d On Middle East policy: \u201cFor the 11th time, Trump falsely claims the U.S. has spent $7 trillion on Middle East wars. One Brown University estimate puts it at $4.3 trillion.\u201d On the domestic economy: \u201cFor the 16th time, Trump falsely claims \u2018wages are going up for the first time in many, many years.\u2019 They have been rising since 2014.\u201d", "Trump on dealing with North Korea: \u201cI may go in, it may not work out, I leave. I'm not going to be a John Kerry.\u201d For the 10th time in office, he falsely says the Obama administration gave Iran $150 billion.", "One of the most remarkable moments from Dale\u2019s livetweet comes in the 21st minute of Trump\u2019s speech, when Trump breaks into a convoluted denial of collusion with the Russian government by suggesting a Trump-campaign-connected Russian lawyer acknowledged her ties to Vladimir Putin to defame Trump because he had been so unforgiving with Russia. Over two tweets, we watch Dale try to make sense of this argument and then, counter to the longstanding practice of rendering presidential speech sensible, simply give up: \u201cI'm tougher on Russia. Nobody ever thought. In fact. Have you heard about the lawyer? For a year, a woman lawyer\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d Trump is offering an elaborate and bizarre theory for why Natalia Veselnitskaya now claims to be an \u201cinformant\u201d in contact with the Russian government, claiming it's actually because he's so tough on Russia that\u2009\u2026\u2009I don't even understand.", "\u201cI'm tougher on Russia. Nobody ever thought. In fact. Have you heard about the lawyer? For a year, a woman lawyer\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d", "Trump is offering an elaborate and bizarre theory for why Natalia Veselnitskaya now claims to be an \u201cinformant\u201d in contact with the Russian government, claiming it's actually because he's so tough on Russia that\u2009\u2026\u2009I don't even understand.", "This last admission by Dale not only highlights the incongruity of Trump\u2019s argument rather than imposing a false coherence; the speech act also rhetorically positions Dale as a vulnerable authority seeking audience trust through revelation of uncertainty and his own limitations. So while the traditional \u201cobjective\u201d view of news reporting focuses on logos and ethos, Dale adds the third crucial element of communication \u2013 pathos \u2013 by inviting the audience on his journey of witnessing Trump's speech. Grabe and Zhou (2003, 16) write, \u201cWhen the audience identifies with the storyteller's point of view and \u2018suffers with\u2019 the characters and the circumstances of the plot, pathos is fully realized.\u201d While the traditional model encourages reporters to keep their suffering to themselves (Parks 2018a), when Dale laments \u201cI don't even understand\u201d what Trump is trying to say, he invites the audience to suffer with him.", "Dale deconstructs Trump\u2019s rhetoric through the remainder of the speech, noting in a follow-up to the collusion argument that attacks on his Veterans Affairs nominee are \u201call innuendo from an unnamed \u2018they\u2019\u201d \u2013 an observation that illustrates the vagueness of Trump\u2019s accusations. Dale also pauses to emphasize Trump\u2019s use of possessive language when referring to US citizens: \u201c\u2018I love my farmers.\u2019 Interesting \u2018my.\u2019\u201d Egan had demonstrated Trump\u2019s objectification more subtly with back-to-back tweets about Trump saying \u201cwherever the hell he is\u201d regarding Bill Schuette and Trump quoting himself \u2013 \u201cI said get that woman that ran Michigan\u201d \u2013 when acknowledging RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel. These quotes suggest, without saying, that Trump treats people instrumentally, not relationally. But when Trump brought up the Soo Locks for the second time in the speech, pledging to act immediately to fix them, Egan simply picked up Trump\u2019s rhetoric linking foreign and domestic failures: \u201cAfter spending all that money in the Mideast, can you imagine \u2013 We can't fix a lock.\u201d Dale, meanwhile, brings skepticism to Trump\u2019s sudden enthusiasm about the locks: \u201cTrump says that as soon as he gets back to Washington he is going to get to work on fixing Michigan's Soo Locks, which he sounds like he may have just heard of.\u201d With about 12 min left in the speech, when Trump suddenly starts reading from his script, Dale catches it: \u201c\u2018It's time to look past the old divisions\u2009\u2026\u2009and finally come together as one nation under God,\u2019 Trump says, returning to his prepared text, after\u2009\u2026\u2009that.\u201d Dale also captures a significant Trump self-deconstruction. Ending his speech, Trump circled back to the Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner and laid bare his disdain of the annual ritual: I could be up there tonight, smiling like I love where they\u2019re hitting you shot after shot, these people they hate your guts, shot, and then I\u2019m supposed to [big fake grin] and you know, you gotta smile. And if you don\u2019t smile they\u2019ll say \u201cHe-he was terrible, he couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d And if you do smile, they\u2019ll say \u201cWhat was he smiling about?\u201d You know, there\u2019s no win.This is a moment of rare and even poignant honesty from Trump, expressing what previous presidents might have felt but would not say. Most news media ignored this unpresidential, unflattering, but humanizing admission, but Dale captured the pathos, tweeting, \u201cTrump says he could be at the \u2018phony\u2019 correspondents dinner putting on a fake smile because the media demands one, but he wouldn't want to be smiling because he doesn't like those people.\u201d", "I could be up there tonight, smiling like I love where they\u2019re hitting you shot after shot, these people they hate your guts, shot, and then I\u2019m supposed to [big fake grin] and you know, you gotta smile. And if you don\u2019t smile they\u2019ll say \u201cHe-he was terrible, he couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d And if you do smile, they\u2019ll say \u201cWhat was he smiling about?\u201d You know, there\u2019s no win.", "Finally, on Trump\u2019s concluding point, which Egan tweeted in part as the direct unchallenged quote \u201cI accomplished more than I promised and I'm doing it for you,\u201d Dale tweets: Trump now says \u201csomebody from the news\u201d is the one who said Trump is the only one who \u201caccomplished more than he promised.\u201d He is the one who said that, though he keeps attributing it to unnamed others.", "Trump now says \u201csomebody from the news\u201d is the one who said Trump is the only one who \u201caccomplished more than he promised.\u201d He is the one who said that, though he keeps attributing it to unnamed others."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Carnival, in Bakhtin\u2019s conception, can be a positive time in which social cohesion is partially renewed through the self-aware profaning and debasing of official hierarchies and figureheads by multivocal, highly participatory rites and festivities. Donald Trump used carnival tactics to great success in the 2016 US presidential election (Gaufman 2018) but, despite widespread expectation that Trump would become \u201cpresidential\u201d once he assumed office and frequent efforts by mainstream reporters to contort his wildly abnormal pronouncements into official forms (Parks 2018b), Trump has effectively merged the \u201ccarnival\u201d world with the \u201cofficial\u201d one, transforming the public sphere into a burlesque with sweeping and tragic real-world consequences for democratic institutions, marginalized groups, and efforts to fight global climate change (Kellner 2018). This paper highlights an alternative to the dominant journalistic approach of framing such a carnivalesque public figure through normative practices that legitimize that figure as an exemplar of official, mainstream discourse. The alternative approach \u2013 a rhetorical \u201cthird way\u201d between the twentieth-century objectivity model and the ridicule and satire provided by late-night comedy and political commentators \u2013 is news reporting that uses the full rhetorical trove of logos, ethos, and pathos to make salient the carnivalesque nature of the aberrant politician\u2019s behavior, as Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale does in his frequent coverage of Donald Trump.", "Analysis of Dale\u2019s live-tweeting of a Trump rally compared to the Detroit Free Press\u2019s Paul Egan, representing the dominant objectivity paradigm, shows that Dale regularly employed three strategies to foreground the carnivalesque nature of Trump\u2019s rhetoric: emphasizing unpresidential speech, rather than normalizing it; highlighting and tracking dishonest statements as they are uttered, rather than repeating or eliding them; and transparently and affectively deconstructing rhetorical tropes, rather than taking them at face value. There are not many occasions where Egan and Dale chose to tweet off the same Trump statement, which is indicative of disparate framing emphases. When they did, Egan tended to report summatively on what Trump said and to select an on-message quote. Dale typically pulled out the grotesque or false aspects of the statement. These differently oriented speech acts produce vastly different impressions of Trump as a communicator and a human being. A helpful question for journalists, scholars, and citizens is: Which frame is more salient for a democratic citizenry?", "I argue that Dale\u2019s approach better captures the essence of Trump and his daily assault on democratic norms, and therefore better serves citizens seeking guidance to make informed decisions (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2014). Dale\u2019s framing represents a movement urging journalists to adopt post-normative approaches to covering Trump, who has used traditional values such as \u201cbalance\u201d and \u201cobjectivity\u201d (Crouse 1973; Mindich 1998; Waisbord 2018) to normalize his aberrant messages. This work may be easier for Dale, as a foreign correspondent representing the Canadian press, than it is for American journalists, for whom patriotic obligation (Parks 2019) and \u201crespecting the office\u201d of the presidency are cultural common sense. Dale, reporting from a country that has been overtly at odds with the US administration, may in a sense be acting in a nationalistic context comparable to American journalists reluctant to directly criticize Trump. But Dale also informs a substantial US audience through social media, and his position with one foot in each country provides him perspective from which US journalists and citizens can learn. From the view of feminist standpoint epistemology, an alternative model to journalistic objectivity offered by Steiner (2018), being both an outsider to American political culture and an insider in national journalistic circles might give Dale greater insight into the ideological traps of the American objectivity paradigm.", "What do Dale\u2019s reporting strategies accomplish? Journalistically, they fulfill key normative requirements of the field that have been frequently neglected in standard coverage of Trump's rhetoric \u2013 particularly the discipline of verification (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2014), a key driver of both journalistic logos and ethos. Unlike reporting that simply repeats Trump's claims \u2013 like an NBC News (2018) tweet passing on Trump's baseless assertion that court filings by special counsel Robert Mueller were exculpatory \u2013 Dale's reporting regularly places claims in factual context as they are uttered. Such speech acts redirect Trump's claims from the official contexts that lend them formal legitimacy and toward the realm of carnival, which invites ambiguous response and active evaluation on the part of the audience. This is a crucial rhetorical move for arming citizens to recognize the deviant nature of Trump\u2019s behavior.", "Dale performs this speech act through the genre of news reporting, not political commentary. He witnesses events and tells people what happened, with both factual and emotional context, which is not the same as opining about whether the US should build a border wall or how best to negotiate with foreign governments. Dale\u2019s move is to realign newsgathering practice with the contemporary rhetorical and political environment.", "Journalists can adopt similar rhetorical practices to cover Trump and other carnivalesque actors more productively by shifting the frame from the content of the rhetoric to the context of it, taking into account not \u201cwhat\u2019s in the box but who gets to decide its boundaries and shape\u201d (Cloud 2018, 9). Doing so both de-emphasizes the content, which is often false or misleading, and denaturalizes the context \u2013 the grotesquery surrounding the utterance. When political actors are speaking or acting outside of normative political tradition, journalists can point this out. Coded racist language, for instance, should not simply be passed on, but identified as coded racist language. When addressing carnivalesque rhetoric, journalists need not simply tweet or write headlines and leads that validate it; they can immediately verify or challenge the claim. They can demonstrate when a discrete speech act fits in with a broader pattern of speech acts, as when Dale notes not just that Trump has lied but how many times he has uttered a variation of the same lie. If a speaker is being frustratingly dishonest or incoherent, journalists can share that frustration and confusion with their audience, rather than constructing false coherence on behalf of the source. Together, this panoply of strategies can lift news reporting beyond rote fact-checking, which suffers from \u201cnarrowness of focus, hyper-thoroughness, and na\u00efve empiricism,\u201d (Cloud 2018, 54) toward what Cloud calls \u201cframe-checking,\u201d or evaluating political discourse in broader contexts.", "Will such an approach be persuasive for Trump supporters who shut their eyes and ears against critique and build identities around rejection of mainstream reporting (e.g. Gottfried, Stocking, and Grieco 2018)? This is unlikely, until discourse shifts in a way that softens those identities. But for \u201cmost Americans,\u201d who \u201cpay much less attention to news than the minority of highly engaged people who have strong partisan identities\u201d (Grossman 2018, 6), the rhetorical strategies embedded in Dale\u2019s reporting might introduce an element of critical thinking regarding Trump's claims that\u2019s not evoked through traditional stenographic reportage. This may be increasingly effective as more journalists adopt similar strategies. Dale published an op-ed in the Washington Post comparing his methods against the dominant reporting approach (Dale 2018e), and he has won a substantial following that might encourage other political journalists to follow suit. Media scholar Jay Rosen, for instance, tweeted of Dale on October 24, 2018: When the numbers are called and the ledgers cleared, @ddale8 will step forward with a clean conscience. He did what he could. [\u2026] But what about the rest of them?The \u201crest of them\u201d seem to be acknowledging a need for new approaches to covering carnivalesque political rhetoric. CNN launched an occasional real-time practice of using a \u201cFacts First\u201d graphic that incorporates verified information alongside the claims of politicians appearing onscreen (Savransky 2017). NPR Politics on November 9, 2018, posted a tweet contextualizing, rather than reproducing, a Trump assertion: \u201cPresident Trump has a history of making claims of voter fraud without providing evidence to back up his claims. Now, he's doing it again in the Florida Senate race.\u201d The Associated Press, criticized for repeating a Trump error, changed course: \u201cWe have deleted a tweet about President Trump's claim that the U.S. is the only country that grants birthright citizenship because it failed to note that his statement was incorrect\u201d (October 30, 2018). And, shortly after publishing Dale\u2019s op-ed, the Washington Post added a \u201cBottomless Pinocchio\u201d rating to its fact-checking feature to account for relentlessly repeated lies. These moves indicate attempts to pull back focus from isolated utterances toward a broader frame encompassing Trump\u2019s carnivalesque posture toward truth.", "When the numbers are called and the ledgers cleared, @ddale8 will step forward with a clean conscience. He did what he could. [\u2026] But what about the rest of them?", "Agenda-setting theory suggests that consistent and persistent media frames can influence public perceptions of people and events (e.g. McCombs, Shaw, and Weaver 2014). It is reasonable to believe that if Dale\u2019s approach became the dominant journalistic approach, a broader awareness of the carnivalesque nature of Trump\u2019s presidency would take hold."]}], "references": [{"title": "Comedy in Unfunny Times: News Parody and Carnival After 9/11", "year": "2008", "journal": "Critical Studies in Media Communication", "volume": "25", "authors": [{"name": "Achter Paul.", "first_name": "Achter", "last_name": "Paul."}]}, {"title": "Dialogic Absurdity: TV News Parody as a Critique of Genre", "year": "2009", "journal": "Television and New Media", "volume": "10", "authors": [{"name": "Druick Zo\u00eb", "first_name": "Druick", "last_name": "Zo\u00eb"}]}, {"title": "Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm", "year": "1993", "journal": "Journal of Communication", "volume": "43", "authors": [{"name": "Entman Robert M.", "first_name": "Entman", "last_name": "M."}]}, {"title": "In Defense of Textual Analysis: Restoring a Challenged Method for Journalism and Media Studies", "year": "2009", "journal": "Journalism Studies", "volume": "10", "authors": [{"name": "F\u00fcrsich Elfriede.", "first_name": "F\u00fcrsich", "last_name": "Elfriede."}]}, {"title": "The Trump Carnival: Popular Appeal in the Age of Misinformation", "year": "2018", "journal": "International Relations", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Gaufman Elizaveta.", "first_name": "Gaufman", "last_name": "Elizaveta."}]}, {"title": "News as Aristotelian Drama: The Case of 60 Minutes", "year": "2003", "journal": "Mass Communication and Society", "volume": "6", "authors": [{"name": "Grabe Mary Eliazabeth", "first_name": "Grabe", "last_name": "Eliazabeth"}, {"name": "Zhou Shuhua", "first_name": "Zhou", "last_name": "Shuhua"}]}, {"title": "The Hands of Donald Trump: Entertainment, Gesture, Spectacle", "year": "2016", "journal": "HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory", "volume": "6", "authors": [{"name": "Hall Kira", "first_name": "Hall", "last_name": "Kira"}, {"name": "Goldstein Donna M.", "first_name": "Goldstein", "last_name": "M."}, {"name": "Ingram Matthew Bruce", "first_name": "Ingram", "last_name": "Bruce"}]}, {"title": "Disruption, Demonization, Deliverance, and Norm Destruction: The Rhetorical Signature of Donald J.
