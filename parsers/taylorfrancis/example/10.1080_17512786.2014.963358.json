Calls to boycott and shutter the daily TV show came from the island's LGBT advocates because of comments made by La Comay that they considered homophobic. This analysis of 58 texts from four of Puerto Rico's island-wide news outlets provides an opportunity to examine how a region's dominant cultural archetype\u2014that of the motherly and controversial comadre, after which La Comay is named\u2014appeared in boundary work conducted by local journalists as they determined whether La Comay should have been awarded journalistic status. This paper is not meant to be yet another examination of satirical journalism as much as it is a chance to explore the appearance of a region's culture in the construction or maintenance of its journalistic community.", "body": [{"sec_title": "Introduction", "sec_content": ["Puerto Rican publicist Jos\u00e9 Enrique G\u00f3mez Saladin was found dead in November 2012. He had been set on fire and beaten. Local media referred to his death as a result of a kidnapping during a carjacking. The island's popular TV personality, La Comay, however, offered a different explanation: Jos\u00e9 Enrique, as the victim had come to be known, died because he had visited a neighborhood known to be frequented by male prostitutes and that Jos\u00e9 Enrique may have been there to find a man with whom to have sex (Vega 2012). La Comay's comments and questions that insinuated Enrique's guilt in his own death, which she presented on her show SuperXclusivo\u2014\u201cWas this man, Jos\u00e9 Enrique, asking for this?\u201d, \u201cWas he friends with these people?\u201d, \u201cDid he used to be a client of these people?\u201d (Vega 2012)\u2014attracted ire across the island.", "La Comay's comments fueled a strong backlash from the island's LGBT activists who said such comments by La Comay \u201csow hate or revenge in our people\u201d (Serrano 2012). Local journalists chimed in, some suggesting that La Comay's show produced important political satire and public accountability, while others called for La Comay to be boycotted by the public and tossed off the air for serving as a voice of hate. Never mind, for a moment, that all of this debate revolved around a public figure that was a full-sized puppet and costume worn and performed by a man.", "Since 1992, Puerto Rican comedian Antulio Kobbo Santarrosa had donned long, slim legs plus a wig, and while projecting a nasally voice as La Comay, helped the one-hour evening production on the island's WAPA television station earn number-one ratings for its last 10 years on-air in prime time (D\u00e1vila Col\u00f3n 2013a).1 With exposed legs, flashy dresses, and stiletto heels, La Comay interviewed politicians, business owners, journalists, and pop stars\u2014all under the auspices of holding them accountable to public interests and scrutiny (Camacho 2012).2 In turn, La Comay's form of news-entertainment resembled that which increasingly has entered mainstream media\u2014journalistic parody and satire that holds specific journalistic watchdog functions, examples of which include Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert in the United States, and similar news-entertainment shows in Hungary, Australia, Germany, and Palestine (Berkowitz and Gutsche 2012; Carlson and Peifer 2013; Harrington 2012; Imre 2012).", "La Comay's comments about Jos\u00e9 Enrique's death led to a protest, boycott\u2014and ultimate cancelation\u2014of the show. As Pedro Julio Serrano, a gay rights advocate who led a social media campaign to cancel La Comay, said of the show's demise: \u201cNow we can talk. The reign of terror, hatred, intolerance, revenge and violence of Kobbo Santarrosa (the man who played La Comay) has come to an end\u201d (El Vocero 2013). Journalists stepped into the fray, and their opinions of the boycott and La Comay's position within Puerto Rican society ranged from her being a \u201ctwisted cultural tumor\u201d (Iglesias 2012) to being a journalist whose speech should be protected (Rodr\u00edguez Cotto 2012).", "At the center of debate among journalists, however, was a deeper cultural discussion about the role of the press that can be explained, ironically, through La Comay's namesake\u2014the mythical la comadre, a feminine personae in Puerto Rican culture that represents a gossipy godmother who provides a sense of community and protects against harm with loving, even if at times hurtful, advice (Camacho 2012; Lagarde 1987; L\u00f3pez 1999). Indeed, as journalist Sandra Rodr\u00edguez Cotto wrote in 80grados before the La Comay's comment and the ensuing debate, La Comay had \u201cachieved the credibility that eludes so many in so-called formal journalism\u201d (Rodr\u00edguez Cotto 2012).", "This paper, therefore, argues that debate among journalists surrounding La Comay's journalistic role was an attempt at shaping ideological explanations and social expectations of journalism embedded in deeper, regional cultural norms. Such debate, this paper argues, was just as much about determining La Comay's journalistic role as it was about determining the state of Puerto Rico's journalism, judged by the degree to which professional journalists fulfilled the mythical roles and ritual functions of an open press and of la comadre. This paper is not meant to be yet another examination of satirical journalism as much as it is a chance to explore the appearance of a region's culture in the construction or maintenance of its journalistic community.", "We begin the paper with scholarship related to how journalistic communities determine what constitutes journalism, particularly in an era of satirical and parody news. Next, we discuss the la comadre archetype, provide an overview of the Puerto Rican press, and explore La Comay's rise and fall in local media. Following an interpretive textual analysis of news texts surrounding the La Comay boycott, we conclude with a conceptual discussion of the La Comay debate not as a normative critique of journalists' coverage but as a means to interpret larger cultural meanings embedded with discourse of this case (Bird 2003; Gutsche and Salkin 2013)."]}, {"sec_title": "News, Satire, and the Expanded, Contested Journalistic Community", "sec_content": ["In this section, we present a briefing on research related to notions of a journalistic community and how journalists work to construct and maintain their collectives' ideological boundaries.", "Journalists are said to work as an interpretive community, a collective that abides by shared ideologies surrounding the purpose, standards, and social roles of journalism to involve citizens in a public forum (Berkowitz and TerKeurst 1999; Zelizer 2009). In the United States, journalists are trained to be objective in reporting the news, setting aside personal, financial, and political pressures in order to present \u201cunbiased\u201d journalism for the betterment of the public (Gans 2004; Kovach and Rosenstiel 2014; Schudson 2003). Journalistic boundaries are set based upon shared ideologies of what journalism is, its major traits and purposes, and the degree to which those within the journalistic community abide by such standards (Zelizer 1993). In the United States, notions that form journalistic boundaries are often confused with standards of professionalism (Schudson and Anderson 2008), yet, journalistic boundary work is largely seen as a construction of beliefs related to journalism practice and the implementation of those beliefs through responses from within journalistic community (Gutsche 2014a; Lewis 2012). For example, if and when journalists operate outside of the community's norms, leading journalists and news outlets perform \u201cmaintenance\u201d to protect the journalistic \u201cparadigm,\u201d the community's dominant ideologies (Carlson 2012; Hindman 2003). Research suggests that paradigm repair operates from the top down, with a journalistic community's famed journalists\u2014often at a nation's largest and leading news organizations\u2014calling for professional sanctions against those who operated outside of the norms (Frank 2003; Handley 2008; Reese 1990). Examples of such sanctions include times in which popular, mainstay news outlets use shame and marginalization to silence those who stray from journalistic norms (i.e. Carlson and Berkowitz 2014) or come together to share in dominant storytelling that supports the legitimacy and authority of press narratives and press explanation of social issues and events (i.e. Gutsche 2011).", "Journalistic boundaries\u2014and the work related to creating and maintaining them\u2014have changed as an expansion of the internet and cable channels has forced traditional journalists to redefine the field and challenge traditional journalistic standards. In addition, more recent scholarship has examined international journalistic debates about the \u201ctruthiness\u201d of emerging news-entertainment such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report (Baym 2010; Carlson and Peifer 2013; Faina 2012).3 The hosts\u2014dressed in suits and ties and sitting behind news desks with graphics and sets that resemble professional cable news channels\u2014invite and interview top politicians, journalists, and authors about serious issues with a twist of humor (Waisanen 2009). Neither of the hosts publically acknowledges a journalistic mission, however, and Stewart and Colbert are not alone in their genre and how they operate within a news-entertainment environment. Across the globe, other news-entertainment shows include The Chaser\u2019s War on Everything in Australia (Harrington 2012), Heti Hetes (The Weekly Seven) in Hungary (Imre 2012), Watan Ala Watar (Country Hanging by a Thread) in Palestine (Sienkiewicz 2012), and Les Guignols de l\u2019info (The Puppets of Information), the latter being a French puppet show that became famous in the 1990s (Doyle 2012). Stewart's and Colbert's shows, however, have been examined for both their political rhetoric (Cao 2010) and the potential \u201cjournalistic objectivity\u201d of \u201cfake news\u201d (Baym and Jones 2012; Carlson and Berkowitz 2014; Shifman 2012). Research, however, continues to call for additional focus on complicating the forces at play within challenges to journalistic legitimacy and meaning-making (Berkowitz and Gutsche 2012), of which the La Comay debate serves as such an opportunity."]}, {"sec_title": "Puerto Rican Press Meets La Comay ", "sec_content": ["In this section, we present the news media landscape of the mainstream Puerto Rican press and present La Comay as both a cultural archetype of motherly love and gossip mongering as well as a television sensation.", "While Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States, its media system is rarely connected to larger discussions of US press systems. The island's media system is similar to the mainland's, however\u2014a mix of public and private media outlets, including public broadcasting that operates in a similar funding and public-service structure as in the domestic United States (Surlin and Soderlund 1990). Spanish-language print, radio, and television programming dominate the media field, as nearly 95 percent of the island speak Spanish. Media include cable stations from mainland United States\u2014including Telemundo and Univision\u2014and English-language local print and web publications (Lugo-Ort\u00edz 2012). Puerto Rican press share dominant journalistic practices with the rest of the United States, with norms including objectivity, accuracy, and a sense of serving as watchdogs in order to maintain legitimacy in the marketplace (Ayala and Bernabe 2007; Surlin and Soderlund 1990). College-level journalism education in Puerto Rico, for instance, relies upon its historic relationships with the United States, Brazil, Spain, and Portugal to maintain traditional journalistic norms in a changing media landscape (L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda 2010). As the island's news outlets have turned to social media and alternative approaches to the news to widen audiences during a recent economic downtown, journalists have begun revisiting the status of their press system (Fuller 2010). Nearly 77 percent of Puerto Rican journalists surveyed in 2010, for instance, said that they were concerned about increasing sensationalism and a growth of alternative news outlets (Lugo-Ort\u00edz 2012). The La Comay debate, then, came at a time when journalists were already critical of the industry and provided an opportunity for a cultural examination of what the press does.", "As this paper argues, debate among Puerto Rican journalists during SuperXclusivo's 2012 boycott about La Comay's journalistic fit was secondary to discussion about La Comay's ritualistic function as a social critic. Indeed, by name, La Comay held just as much cultural significance as in the topics she covered\u2014and how she covered them (Camacho 2012)\u2014La Comay's show, SuperXclusivo (\u201cSuper Exclusive\u201d), had long been charged to be a show centered on sensationalism (Camacho 2012; Vega 2012). In Puerto Rico, the archetype of La Comay\u2014also known as la comadre (the godmother)\u2014represents an empowered leader with patriarchal characterizations. Having emerged from the days of early Spanish and Catholic colonization when local communities called for guidance and support while under armed rule, la comadre today is applied when one participates in the ritual of baptism and assumes a co-parenting role within the family (L\u00f3pez 1999). The la comadre archetype holds an unquestionable duty to help others in daily decisions and in times of need; she provides her family and community members with watchful eyes, emotional support, and guidance (Camacho 2012). Beyond her protective characteristics, la comadre is also considered a \u201cgossipmonger\u201d\u2014a characteristic that makes her unwelcome\u2014but as someone who is ultimately portrayed in literature and popular histories as one who provides a sense of community and love (Lagarde 1987). It is the role of la comadre that La Comay was argued to have fit the archetype\u2014a \u201ccommunity busybody, looking into and informing the public about things like alleged extramarital affairs, fiscal misconduct, and legal controversies\u201d (Camacho 2012, 131)\u2014elements which also match elements of journalism (\u00d6rnebring and Jonsson 2004).", "During its run from 1999 to 2013, La Comay's show, SuperXclusivo, relied on slapstick humor, stereotypes, and popular culture for its satire. SuperXclusivo drew politicians and business leaders to its studios near Puerto Rico's capital city of San Juan and was considered to walk a line between humor and watchdog journalism in that La Comay had often \u201c[warned] elected officials and other government leaders that she is watching them and that she plans to keep the public informed of what they are really up to\u201d (Camacho 2012, 132, emphasis in original).", "A month before the La Comay boycott began, the Associated Press discussed La Comay this way: This five-foot-tall character with a foam head painted with outrageous red lips, a shrill voice and a penchant for salacious details rules Puerto Rico's gossip circuit \u2026 La Comay dishes it out with ominous music playing in the background, talking about everyone from Mexican crooner Luis Miguel to Puerto Rico's own Miss Universe beauty queen Zuleyka Rivera.

(Coto 2012)", "The article continues by saying La Comay's popularity: isn't lost on government officials including the island's governor, its justice secretary and the Senate president, all of whom have granted La Comay live interviews while sometimes shunning other media.

SuperXclusivo was shuttered on January 9, 2013.", "To examine the cultural meanings of journalistic boundary work in this case, we were guided by the following research questions: RQ1: How did Puerto Rican journalists explain La Comay\u2019s journalistic status in coverage of the La Comay boycott?RQ2: How did journalists explain and describe the debate surrounding La Comay's comments and the show's boycott and cancelation?RQ3: What meanings related to the role of local culture in journalistic boundary work may be derived from an analysis of this news coverage?

In turn, the researcher provides a deep interpretation of news as culture, particularly as a ritual of journalistic storytelling that revolves around characters, plot, and meaning (Carey 2009). The resulting analysis, therefore, is focused more on the meanings inherent in the case at hand rather than more generalizable findings that can be applied to cases elsewhere. That said, deep readings of news texts provide audiences and journalists with a better understanding of how the news explains everyday life through ideology, power, and story (Berkowitz and Eko 2007; Gutsche 2014b).", "Because we were interested in the immediate response to the La Comay controversy within the Puerto Rican journalism community, we focused on immediate news commentary and reporting between December 2, 2012 and January 22, 2013. This time period accounts for the first month following the airing of the problematic SuperXclusivo broadcast (December 4) and an additional two weeks following the cancelation of the show on January 9, 2013. Because we live in mainland United States and did not have ready access to Puerto Rican news broadcasts, we examined coverage that appeared in the island's dominant mainstream newspapers and websites. In lieu of access to library electronic database that included Puerto Rican newspapers, we searched the outlet's websites for the term \u201cLa Comay.\u201d", "After multiple readings, we settled on 58 texts as being relevant to this study. Our search of San Juan-based El Vocero (The Spokesman), a 166,300-circulation daily newspaper, resulted in 16 articles related to the La Comay debate. A search of the news website 80grados (80degrees) yielded six texts. The San Juan-based, 131,600-circulation daily newspaper Primera Hora (First Hour) provided 15 texts for the study. Lastly, a website search of El Nuevo D\u00eda (The New Day), a 200,000-circulation daily newspaper based in San Juan, provided 21 texts.4 All texts included in this study were categorized as news stories, newspaper editorials, and columns written by journalists.", "Once all articles were collected, they were printed and shared among the study's authors. As a means to identify and explicate cultural meanings embedded in news texts (Lindlof and Taylor 2010), two of the three authors who spoke Spanish followed dominant standards for performing qualitative textual analysis, meeting multiple times to read the texts and to identify common themes associated with debate about La Comay's status within Puerto Rico's journalistic interpretive community.", "For this study, we examined texts for characteristics that have appeared in previous research related to journalistic boundary work, including statements of journalistic practice and norms through direct appeals of the journalists and their sources (Anderson and Kincaid 2013; Zelizer 1993), rhetoric of the media outlet's social contribution (Carlson and Berkowitz 2014; Coddington 2012), and the role of humor, parody, and satire in addressing the issues of the day through sharing information and commentary (Carlson and Peifer 2013; Faina 2012).", "Our readings were informed by scholarship related to dominant culture and press in Puerto Rico, which provided cultural context and validity that assisted translation from Spanish to English during analysis and in the writing of the paper. Two of the three authors speak Spanish as their first language; one of whom was born and raised in Puerto Rico. One Spanish-speaking author conducted initial translations, which were verified by the second author; both Spanish-speaking authors further verified the application and ultimate representation of the translation as it appeared in the paper.", "We recognize the challenges and power dynamics inherent in the desire of the translator to replace one word or phrase with another and the ease by which she decides within the moment \u201cto opt for one rendition\u201d of language \u201cand not others\u201d (Pym 2010, 1) based, in part, on seeking a translation in which singular meanings are assigned to what are otherwise complex experiences and expressions of culture (Bhabha 2004; Robinson 2014). We hope our understandings of the comments help to explain a deeper cultural purpose of the journalistic boundary work that occurred in debate of La Comay by employing notions of la comadre and her cultural role in Puerto Rican culture.", "In the analysis below, we address our first two research questions\u2014how journalists explained La Comay's journalistic status and described the debate surrounding her comments and the related boycott\u2014by explicating three major themes related to journalists' coverage of La Comay. Specifically, we explain how journalists used this debate to (1) measure the state of the island's news as an institution of local journalists' expressed interests in providing \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cwatchdog\u201d journalism; (2) strengthen the journalistic status of mainstream news outlets by diminishing La Comay's journalistic legitimacy; and (3) reify the expectations of local journalism as a cultural institution and social force."]}, {"sec_title": "Leveling La Comay to Measure Local Journalism", "sec_content": ["In debating La Comay's position as a journalist, the press used the conflict as an opportunity to question the current state of Puerto Rican journalism. By and large, journalists neither commented on La Comay's speech nor did they support her comments outright. Yet, through their reporting and commentary, journalists examined the value and role of local journalism by taking sides on the degree to which La Comay presented the news or provided entertainment.", "Of most interest to journalists was the question of whether La Comay may have filled a democratic role, which journalists had reported in recent years as being absent in the island's mainstream news media (Lugo-Ort\u00edz 2012). Indeed, journalists wrote that La Comay may have earned watchdog status based upon how she was perceived by her audiences and sources. A journalism professor from the local university, Universidad del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (University of the Sacred Heart), wrote on 80grados, for instance, that \u201c[f]ormer governors\u201d and other island politicians and business leaders \u201csat down in that chair, and have looked directly into the eyes of that doll as if she was real,\u201d providing interviews about social and governmental policy similar to what occurs on more traditional newscasts (Jim\u00e9nez 2012).", "Other suggestions of La Comay's possible journalistic status appeared in coverage that highlighted comments by SuperXclusivo's producers and co-hosts about the show's journalistic qualities. \u201cAt the beginning, [SuperXclusivo] was 75 percent \u2018party and fun\u2019 and maybe 20 or so about things that were serious issues,\u201d La Comay's co-host, Hector Travieso, told El Nuevo D\u00eda (Vega Calles 2013). \u201cIn recent years it took a significant turn and it became an investigative news program.\u201d Hints at La Comay's journalistic status appeared in subtle ways, as well, including in the form of back-handed acknowledgments. One Primera Hora news article, for example, detailed La Comay's initial acquiescence to protestors that the television broadcast would be pre-recorded and edited to monitor what could be considered offensive speech.", "In the article, journalists quoted LGBT activist Francisco Cartagena Mendez as saying that despite the show's suggestions of being sensitive in the future, \u201cin a few months they will resume their derogatory, discriminatory and insensitive way of presenting the news\u201d (Primera Hora 2013). In such instances, journalists turned to sources and their own opinions to measure La Comay's speech against traditional journalistic standards\u2014those shared, to a large degree, among Puerto Rican journalists (Lugo-Ort\u00edz 2012) and taught in the island's journalism schools (L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda 2010).", "Throughout news coverage, La Comay was described as being considered by both audiences and sources as being \u201creal\u201d to the degree that she was awarded both human and journalistic legitimacy. In fact, journalists acknowledged La Comay's use of verification, triangulation, and watchdog journalism in her coverage of important issues. Using these journalistic standards as a foundation for critique, even journalists who argued against La Comay's journalistic status (and the status of Santarrosa, the man under the La Comay mask), did so by placing both La Comay and Santarrosa within the journalistic community as a means to measure her quality and status within it. Such a measurement allowed mainstream reporters to present themselves as \u201ctrue\u201d journalists.", "As journalist Wilda Rodr\u00edguez wrote in a column for 80grados, as a means of differentiating journalists from La Comay, \u201cSantarrosa cannot be considered a journalist, nor be required to work by the rules of ethics that guide us \u2026 Santarrosa is not a journalist neither does he exercise journalism. He is the host of an entertainment program\u201d (Rodr\u00edguez 2012). One Primera Hora news article turned to Pedro Julio Serrano\u2014an activist for LGBT rights who led a Facebook effort to oust La Comay\u2014to identify the puppet's potential news function by comparing the show's social influence to that of what news programs should provide. \u201cIt's time for other media outlets,\u201d he stated (R\u00edos Camacho 2013): most of which meet the social function of educating and entertaining to evaluate the content of the programming they produce for this country to make sure they do not violate the individual and collective dignity of our homeland.

Another columnist, this time at El Nuevo D\u00eda, made a similar argument, recognizing La Comay's popularity, but questioning the social value of her \u201cdaily news\u201d: Certainly there is an audience that wants to hear daily news commentary with humor \u2026 they could create a space that satirizes our daily reality without falling on racist, vulgar, homophobic, and degrading comments as La Comay has for years.

One El Vocero article, for instance, highlighted the fact that SuperExclusivo was estimated to have attracted some $80 million over the course of its broadcasting years (D\u00e1vila Col\u00f3n 2013a). And in 80grados, one columnist was quite bold about the financial competition La Comay brought to the media field and the responsibility of advertisers to support such programming. \u201cWhen the furor passes,\u201d the journalist wrote, \u201cadvertisers and publicity agencies will come back to succumb to the ratings\u201d by funding and producing shows similar to La Comay with a flavor of ridicule as a means to draw audiences (Mattei 2012).", "Still, debate among journalists about the financial and social contributions of La Comay were further complicated by the \u201cgood\u201d she may have done as a public voice, the role of both la comadre and of a Western form of news, which mainstream Puerto Rican journalists follow (L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda 2010; L\u00f3pez 1999; Lugo-Ort\u00edz 2012). One news article in El Nuevo D\u00eda, for instance, quoted La Comay proponents, one of whom said that audience members and journalists should support La Comay, despite her speech, because of \u201call the good things that La Comay has done for Puerto Rico and all the [criminal] cases that she has solved\u201d (El Nuevo D\u00eda 2012).", "Journalists' news articles and opinion pieces discussed La Comay's social and journalistic value in ways that demanded from their own media system the very kind of voice associated with la comadre and a watchdog press\u2014authoritative, populist, and controversial. Both La Comay and local mainstream press, then, were judged in terms of their purposes of community building and protection by which both mainstream press and la comadre were said to have provided. Therefore, in the next section, we interpret news coverage of La Comay's boycott and cancelation as journalists not only reifying the standards of Puerto Rican journalism but also set expectations of local journalism that can be explained through the archetype of la comadre. "]}, {"sec_title": "Articulating Journalistic Expectations: the Press as la Comadre?", "sec_content": ["At the core of the debate about La Comay and her journalistic function, journalists called for a return to or a rekindling of a public-service press in Puerto Rico (Ayala and Bernabe 2007; L\u00f3pez Garcia 2010; Lugo-Ort\u00edz 2012; Surlin and Soderlund 1990), elements of which La Comay may have performed as her namesake, la comadre, an archetype revered for speaking out about social issues. As a columnist for El Vocero wrote, \u201cLa Comay covered news that was gagged or hidden. She began to successfully fulfill the gaps of a manipulative and offensive colonial press\u201d (D\u00e1vila Col\u00f3n 2013a).", "La Comay was also described as speaking plainly to her audiences, which created a bond of trust and familiarity that led to audiences adopting her \u201cforms of street language,\u201d including \u201cQu\u00e9 bochinche\u201d (\u201cWhat super gossip\u201d), \u201cT\u00edralo al medio\u201d (\u201cThrow it to the middle\u201d), \u201cDame sangre\u201d (\u201cGive me blood\u201d), and even some English phrases, such as \u201cLet's get ready to rumble.\u201d These \u201cisland colloquialisms\u201d not only \u201cadded flair to her commentary\u201d (Camacho 2012, 131), but also connected La Comay to the average viewer and fill the role of la comadre, \u201cfictive kin\u201d (Ho 1987) that provide \u201cintimate\u201d relationships that cross traditional notions of family, socioeconomic divides, and generational distances (L\u00f3pez 1999).", "La Comay's language was a tool for building relationships between herself and her audiences: during her shows, La Comay often referred to her audience members as \u201cmis queridos seguidores\u201d (\u201cmy dear followers\u201d or as \u201cmy darlings\u201d), for example. It was La Comay's language that was considered unpopular speech, which drew attention, however. Nonetheless, even the strongest language about social issues could be considered tales told by la comadre, spoken out of concern, as a parent who guides a child through social expectations (Ho 1987; L\u00f3pez 1999). During La Comay's boycott, for instance, local journalists wrote that despite her \u201chate speech\u201d (such as the comments associated with Enrique's death), La Comay remained both \u201cloved and hated in Puerto Rico,\u201d as El Nuevo D\u00eda told its readers (Berr\u00edos 2012). El Nuevo D\u00eda columnist Gabino Inglesias was more striking in his own critique of La Comay, disregarding what some journalists called her \u201cgood deeds,\u201d calling her \u201ca twisted cultural tumor\u201d because of her disparaging remarks (Iglesias 2012).", "Despite direct comments made in opposition to La Comay, journalists returned to La Comay's \u201cfame\u201d and \u201clegend\u201d (D\u00e1vila Col\u00f3n 2013a) as a means to call for a more open and possibly controversial, though respectful, media discourse. As one journalist wrote in El Nuevo D\u00eda, local broadcasters \u201craise the level of its television offering because it's clear that the audience today wants more respect and better programming\u201d (Berr\u00edos 2013). One El Vocero article stated that with \u201cpower and with a frank, straightforward, style, La Comay dared to say what many did not\u201d (D\u00e1vila Col\u00f3n 2013a) and argued that: [a]s a program of gossip, social satire, light press and entertainment, this show transcended barriers, occupied spaces of public discussion, set agendas that no one dreamed of \u2026 even with the displeasure of the powerful. ", "[a]s a program of gossip, social satire, light press and entertainment, this show transcended barriers, occupied spaces of public discussion, set agendas that no one dreamed of \u2026 even with the displeasure of the powerful.", "La Comay held journalistic roles similar to those called for by journalism educators in Puerto Rico in that they have outlined ones crucial for a press that is \u201cprofessional\u201d and that is informed by \u201can ethical sense of social responsibility\u201d (L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda 2010). For example, that La Comay spoke of issues that \u201cmany did not\u201d resembles the local journalistic aim to put watchdog journalism above sensationalism (Lugo-Ort\u00edz 2012) and the purpose of la comadre to broach difficult topics with her loved ones and community (Camacho 2012).", "That La Comay's topics \u201ctranscended barriers\u201d mirrors local journalists' historic interests in relaying meaning and information across social and economic divides (Surlin and Soderlund 1990) and la comadre's purpose (Lagarde 1987). La Comay's attempt to formulate space for \u201cpublic discussion\u201d and to \u201cset agendas\u201d appears in local journalists' call for using the press as an open forum for discussion and debate (Ayala and Bernabe 2007) and the purpose of la comadre to guide her community and children through issues she deems important (Ho 1987). Even La Comay's approach\u2014\u201cher sharp tongue\u201d and \u201cmerciless lashes\u201d that made her an enemy to some and a \u201clegend\u201d to others because of her \u201cgood deeds\u201d\u2014fulfilled local roles of Puerto Rican journalists as critical commentators of government and business (L\u00f3pez Garcia 2010; Lugo-Ort\u00edz 2012) and la comadre as a watchful caretaker (Lagarde 1987; L\u00f3pez 1999).", "Indeed, with La Comay's controversy aside, journalists reported about her role in discussing difficult aspects of society and shared quotes from fellow journalists and from media scholars that showed the importance of La Comay's \u201cwatchdog\u201d approaches. El Nuevo D\u00eda, for instance, quoted a journalism professor as saying that the tension surrounding La Comay's tenor was \u201ca symptom of the problems facing the country and not the cause\u201d (Vargas Casiano 2013). He continued to say that with the cancelation of SuperExclusivo, \u201cthe problems do not disappear.\u201d", "As another example of debating La Comay's role as a public forum, a columnist in 80grados wrote that \u201c[t]he problem is not these channels, these \u2018messengers,\u2019 but the inability that we have to change the channel or be able to provide good content that can supply a good alternative to the viewers\u201d (Franco 2012). Journalistic commentary about the need for \u201cbetter programming,\u201d \u201calternatives\u201d for viewers, and plain-language news about island society operated as a call for local press to serve the function of la comadre, to better provide a public forum, and tackle difficult topics."]}, {"sec_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "sec_content": ["To address our third research question, we use this section to conceptualize larger meanings from this particular case that relate to the area of journalistic boundary work. Throughout our analysis, we have argued that journalistic debate about La Comay's journalistic role was just as much about La Comay's position to serve as la comadre. Journalists used this debate as an opportunity to call for fellow members of the press to ask difficult questions of local politicians and celebrities, to broach taboo topics, and to provide explanation to local communities about the challenges and issues of everyday life\u2014as La Comay may have, as la comadre should, and so, too, should local journalists.", "To be clear, this paper is not about whether La Comay was supported or harmed in critique of her speech; instead, we wish to explicate the region's cultural influence upon journalistic boundary work through notions of la comadre to examine the degree to which local culture appears in how journalists understand, explain, and shape what they do\u2014and how they do it. These were influences that came from outside the journalistic community\u2014influences of la comadre\u2014that played a role in the very assessments journalists made about their field, explaining their own acts through the archetype of comadre by assessing, critiquing, arguing for a particular position of change or dominant interpretation and using language, viewpoints, and reveling in controversy in order to assess who was a journalist\u2014all for, in their own words, the protection of the field.", "The conceptual outcomes from this study provide a case in which journalistic boundary work and paradigm maintenance is more complicated than the top-down process of dominant journalistic voices pressuring others in the field to follow particular norms and behaviors. In fact, this case reveals how cultural forces from outside the journalistic community influence journalistic ideologies, further complicating the understanding of the pressures inherent in the formation and maintenance of journalistic boundaries and ideologies. Our analysis acknowledges a multitude of overt messages about La Comay's journalistic status and the journalistic value of her speech; however, we have also identified a nuanced discussion about the role of La Comay to uphold her namesake and about the ability of the press to perform some of the same duties of La Comay that reporters scrutinized.", "It is within this subtle discourse that cultural forces emerge within local journalists' debate. Press expectations that La Comay should abide by notions of \u201cobjectivity\u201d and of a serious tone served merely to formulate deeper discussions about the perceived needs of local audiences, including journalists themselves, for a press that holds similar functions to la comadre. It was only when journalists created a sense of legitimacy to critique La Comay by placing her\u2014however loosely\u2014within the journalistic community that mainstream journalists could call for media that is both considered \u201crespectful,\u201d that functions as a voice for the people, that discusses difficult and controversial topics, and that guides the community through challenging times\u2014in effect, the goals of la comadre. Surmising the intentions of a collective such as journalists is a difficult, perhaps impossible, task; however, we consider the richness uncovered from this cultural examination of journalistic boundary as a foundation upon which to suggest future research to examine discourse from outside the journalistic community as a means by which to measure and further explain how journalists function."]}], "references": [{"title": "\u201cMedia Subservience and Satirical Subversiveness: The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, The Propaganda Model and the Paradox of Parody", "year": "2013", "journal": "Critical Studies in Media Communication", "volume": "30", "authors": [{"name": "Anderson James", "first_name": "Anderson", "last_name": "James", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Kincaid Amie D.", "first_name": "Kincaid", "last_name": "D.", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "\u201cNews Parody in Global Perspectives: Politics, Power, and Resistance", "year": "2012", "journal": "Popular Communication", "volume": "10", "authors": [{"name": "Baym Geoffrey", "first_name": "Baym", "last_name": "Geoffrey", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Jones Jeffrey P.", "first_name": "Jones", "last_name": "P.", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Blasphemy as Sacred Rite/Right: \u2018The Mohammed Cartoons Affair\u2019 and Maintenance of Journalistic Ideology.", "year": "2007", "journal": "Journalism Studies", "volume": "8", "authors": [{"name": "Berkowitz Dan", "first_name": "Berkowitz", "last_name": "Dan", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Eko Leo", "first_name": "Eko", "last_name": "Leo", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": ". \u201cDrawing Lines in the Journalistic Sand: Jon Stewart, Edward R.
