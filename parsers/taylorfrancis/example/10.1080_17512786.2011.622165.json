Using a content analysis of 19 newspapers from throughout Latin America, this study found that newspaper websites are bringing citizens into the virtual newsroom on a limited basis, allowing them to interact with each other and with the newspaper but only to a modest degree. Thus, while all newspaper websites have some multimedia content and most have Facebook and Twitter accounts, few allow readers to report errors, submit their own content, or even contact reporters directly. Further, most online newspaper articles include photos, but video, audio and hyperlinks rarely are used. These results further our understanding of how online interactivity is changing the traditional role of journalists and how Latin America is responding to the challenge. ", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since David Manning White's (1950) seminal study highlighted the decisions Mr. Gates made about which stories would be in the next day's newspaper, the role of journalists as gatekeepers has become one of the central tenets of communication research (Shoemaker and Vos, 2009). But in today's online news ecosystem, ruled by blogs, social media, and a 24-hour news cycle where information has become so prevalent that scholars speak of \u201cambient news\u201d (Hermida, 2010a), the notion of a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d seems like a quaint relic.", "The onset of new technologies, and the resulting pressure on newspapers to incorporate more citizen journalism, has prompted some scholars to posit that the convergence of professional and citizen journalism might perhaps be undermining the traditional gatekeeping model (Bowman and Willis, 2003; Hermida, 2010b), and opening the gate to allow at least some alternative, citizen voices through. The rise of new technologies and the development of a Web 2.0, characterized by its interactive features and user-generated content, have meant a blurring of what journalism is, potentially transforming how it is practiced and who is doing it (Deuze, 2003; Lasica, 2003). Such a fundamental shift brings with it an assortment of challenges and opportunities, as newspapers look to incorporate more interactivity in order to attract more readers, while still maintaining the traditional gatekeeping function so central to a journalist's identity. A burgeoning body of Euro- and US-centric literature has begun to analyze what kinds of interactive elements newspaper websites are offering, but little research has examined how online newspapers in digitally divided regions like Latin America are incorporating this kind of multimedia and participatory content. As previous research on newsroom interactivity favors \u201cearly adapters\u201d (Rogers, 1986), it is worth examining newspapers in Latin America to find whether they are following similar patterns of diffusion, or whether they are incorporating interactive elements in new and different ways than US and European news media. Expanding the sample of extant literature reinforces the generalizability of theoretical interpretations that can be applied across systems (Hanitzsch, 2008). In that sense, Latin America includes an array of socially and politically distinctive countries, but with a shared heritage and, for the most part, with democratic regimes. Studying the Latin American case, then, not only expands current research, but also refines our understanding of online journalism.", "Thus, as newspapers\u2019 struggle to maintain viability in this digital era, this study aims to understand better how newspapers in Latin America are responding to this shift toward participatory journalism, taking into consideration how meaningful such an opening of the gates can be when the bulk of the population is excluded from participating because of lack of Internet access. Drawing on a theoretical framework of gatekeeping and participatory journalism, this study uses a content analysis of 19 newspaper websites in Latin America\u2014one newspaper from each country\u2014to offer an initial exploration of whether newspapers are opening their newsrooms to citizens by providing multimedia features and other web elements that encourage reader participation. Further, because previous research has not reached a consensus on exactly what citizen participation in the newsroom, or interactivity, entails, this study draws on existing literature to define three levels of citizen participation: \u201cMultimedia,\u201d which refers to content forms other than text, such as video and photography, and diverse platforms for the newspaper content, such as mobile devices; \u201cinteractive,\u201d which refers to features that allow users to be more than a receiver and become disseminators of the newspaper content, for example by sharing a story via social media; and \u201cparticipatory,\u201d or those features which enable readers be active users and sources, to the extent that they can contribute their input about the medium and its stories, like submitting a citizen report.", "Such research is important for analyzing how much access to the media is genuinely enjoyed by the average citizen. This also has implications for attracting readers, which is essential for drawing advertising dollars. Further, the interactivity level of a newspaper's website is also important in terms of transforming the traditional role of journalists as gatekeepers. As newspapers increase their interactive and participatory options, they are potentially undermining their own gatekeeping responsibilities, fundamentally changing journalism\u2014and perhaps impacting on democracy\u2014as they open the newsroom to new and alternative voices and perspectives."]}, {"title": "Theoretical Framework and Literature Review", "paragraphs": ["White (1950) contended that gatekeepers in the newsroom regulate the flow of information and knowledge, using varying criteria to control which stories make it into the newspaper (Gieber and Johnson, 1961; Shoemaker, 1991). Gatekeeping is the \u201coverall process through which the social reality transmitted by the news media is constructed\u201d (Shoemaker et al., 2001, p. 233). Extending the notion of gatekeeping from a lone editor with the final say over what is or is not published, other scholars have highlighted the role of newsroom routines, organizational structure and journalistic norms that also influence what becomes news (Gans, 1979; Shoemaker and Reese, 1996).", "In today's digital era, scholars disagree over whether or how the Internet is changing the gatekeeping function. Singer (2005) contended that the same traditional routines and norms found in print newspapers are replicated online, while Bruns (2005) offers the notion of \u201cgatewatching,\u201d a type of news filter. For others, the Web has changed the game entirely, reducing the need for gatekeepers when everyone with access to the Internet can use, create, or disseminate the news that they see fit (Bowman and Willis, 2003; Hermida, 2010b).", "Scholars have attempted to define content from non-professional journalists, referring to citizen journalism, para-journalism, public journalism, user-generated content, and collaborative journalism (Black, 1997; Jaaniste, 2010; Rosen, 2008; Thurman, 2008; Vujnovic et al., 2010). Bowman and Willis's (2003) term \u201cparticipatory journalism\u201d seems to encapsulate \u201cthe collaborative nature of journalism now: professionals and amateurs working together to get the real story, linking to each other across brands and old boundaries to share facts, questions, answers, ideas, perspectives\u201d (Jarvis, 2006).", "In this age of convergence, newspaper readers once considered only as the \u201caudience\u201d are no longer just passive consumers, as digital communication tools are increasingly allowing citizens to both create and disseminate news and information (Bowman and Willis, 2003; Deuze et al., 2007; J\u00f6nsson and \u00d6rnebring, 2011). Accustomed to using blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and other such platforms, citizens have come to want more than just the ability to write a letter to the editor. Internet-savvy newspaper readers now expect some level of interactivity and increased engagement with a news site, forcing traditional news media to rethink not only the process of news production, but also who is considered a journalist (Hayes et al., 2007).", "Studies that have considered why newspapers allow citizen participation suggest it is a combination of democratic ideals and a market-driven bottom line that seeks to increase website traffic (Jenkins, 2006; J\u00f6nsson and \u00d6rnebring, 2011; Vujnovic et al., 2010). Ever-decreasing circulations and advertising revenues have meant newspapers increasingly are looking to the Internet for a way out (Paterson and Domingo, 2008). Still, a recent industry report showed that 20 percent of digital journalism ventures in Latin America do not generate profits (Fundaci\u00f3n Nuevo Periodismo Iberoamericano, 2011). Hermida and Thurman (2008) noted that a news organization's adoption of participatory journalism was in part a result of a cost\u2013benefit analysis. Their study of the BBC found that the time and effort it took to moderate and editorially control user-generated content drained resources that some editors believed could be better spent on traditional newsgathering. Such findings fit well within previous research that has demonstrated the news media's generally dismissive attitude toward the audience (Gans, 1979), and the notion that journalists know better than consumers what is newsworthy (Schlesinger, 1978).", "It should come as no surprise, then, that studies of news organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom indicate that professional journalists are not overhauling their news processes to embrace citizen participation (Deuze, 2003; Domingo et al., 2008). Despite opening their websites to limited user-generated content, news organizations still moderate what is posted, ensuring that any citizen contributions are in line with existing journalistic norms and culture (Hermida and Thurman, 2008). When newsrooms do open the gates, the degree of openness tends to be tied to the stage of the news process (Domingo et al., 2008, see also Singer et al. 2011). Of the five stages of the news production process\u2014access/observation, selection/filtering, processing/editing, distribution, and interpretation\u2014Domingo and his colleagues found that the interpretation stage was the only one significantly open for citizen participation, and that not a single stage allowed citizens to have the final word. Thus, even while exploring avenues for incorporating citizens\u2019 contributions, \u201cinstitutional media are not fully releasing their power over the production process to the citizen\u201d (Domingo et al., 2008, p. 335). In fact, Singer (2005) contended that mainstream journalists normalize participatory media, controlling and adapting it until it fits within traditional journalistic practices and understandings. Thus, while user-generated content often is seen as more democratic and participatory, the lack of change or adaptation in journalistic practices means a fundamental shift in the mindset about the role of citizens in journalism has yet to occur (Williams et al., 2011).", "Research has shown interactivity to be multi-dimensional, but scholars have yet to reach a consensus on what exactly interactivity on news sites entails. Zeng and Li's (2006) analysis of US newspapers suggested two types of online interactivity: interactivity with the content as well as interpersonal interactivity, whereas McAdams (1995) proposed six aspects of interactivity: feedback, control, creativity, productivity, type of communication, and adaptability. Deuze (2003), on the other hand, described three types of interactivity generally allowed on websites: (1) navigational, wherein the user chooses how to browse through content; (2) functional, wherein the user can interact with other users or content producers; and (3) adaptive, wherein the site adapts itself to a user's preferences and habits, and users can upload their own content. In general, interactivity on mainstream media news sites is limited to the navigational level. Lasica (2003) highlighted several ways the audience can participate in mainstream media: staff blogs that include reader comments, emails and direct posts; citizen-authored blogs sanctioned by the newsroom; discussion forums; reader-authored articles (such as those about a high school sporting event, often solicited by the newspaper); and reader photos, videos and eye-witness reports.", "Thus, taken from the preceding literature on participatory journalism and user interactivity, the first research question this study will answer is:  R Q1:\u2002How often do Latin American newspaper websites offer multimedia, interactive and participatory elements, and what kinds of these elements are offered?  ", " R Q1:\u2002How often do Latin American newspaper websites offer multimedia, interactive and participatory elements, and what kinds of these elements are offered?", "Any such discussion of interactivity and online participatory journalism would be remiss if it ignored the question of digital inclusion and who has the ability to participate online, especially in Latin America, where just 35 percent of the population has Internet access (Internet World Stats, 2010). Optimists have heralded the rise of the Internet as a democratic space that can offer greater political access for marginalized groups (Kellner, 2000). Others, however, note the potential for already disenfranchised groups to become further marginalized as technologies leave them farther behind (Bonfadelli, 2002; Kim, 2008).", "More than just lack of access, the digital divide represents a lack of technological know-how, outdated infrastructure, and lack of interest in technologies, making it a cultural, political, and economic divide (Fuchs, 2009). Newhagen and Bucy (2004) outlined four dimensions of access: physical, or ready access to a computer with Internet; system, or ability to access high-speed Internet; cognitive, or the skill to understand what is online and how to search for it; and social access, or differences in access for certain individuals or cultures. If participatory journalism is a democratic ideal about opening the public sphere to citizen input, then it begs the question of how truly democratic or participatory journalism can be when two-thirds of the region is automatically excluded.", "Beginning around 1997, Internet technologies began spreading rapidly, yet unevenly, across Latin America, resulting in a digital divide not just between Latin American countries and other nations in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, but also within Latin America itself (Hawkins and Hawkins, 2003). For example, Argentina currently has the highest percentage of Internet users, with roughly 64 percent of the country connected, and in small Uruguay, with a population of just 3.5 million, more than half the population (53 percent) has access (Internet World Stats, 2010). Yet in Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, only 38 percent of the population is connected, and in Mexico, the second largest country, just 27 percent. Nicaragua has the lowest Internet penetration rate of the region, at just 0.03 percent (Internet World Stats, 2010). Internet use in Latin America is linked to socio-economic inequality, with countries with more unequal income distribution having lower rates of Internet penetration (Hawkins and Hawkins, 2003).", "Exacerbating this is the fact that information communication technologies are more expensive in the poor countries and cheaper in the wealthier ones (Hilbert, 2010). Despite more than 140,000 public Internet access sites identified across Latin America (Maeso and Hilbert, 2006), the poorest populations of the region are still excluded. With just 18\u201367 US cents a week available to spend on information communication technologies, most would not even be able to afford half an hour's access via an Internet caf\u00e9 (Hilbert, 2010). Further, Hughes and Lawson (2005) noted the low print and digital media penetration rates plaguing Latin America. It is questionable, then, whether these segments of the population would use what little Internet time they can pay for to comment on a newspaper's website or send an email to a reporter.", "Thus, the next research questions this study will answer are the following:  R Q2:\u2002Which Latin American newspapers offer more multimedia and interactive elements?  R Q3:\u2002Is the development level of a country related to a newspaper's use of multimedia and participatory content in Latin America?  R Q4:\u2002Is the Internet penetration in a country related to a newspaper's use of multimedia and participatory content in Latin America?

", "", "Despite such access limitations, studies have shown that the Internet, with its interactive capabilities, can boost reader engagement (McMillan and Hwang, 2002), deepen a reader's understanding of an issue (Dalrymple and Scheufele, 2007; Eveland et al., 2004), and increase both the use and discussion of news (de Vreese, 2007). Studies have also shown that news sources that go the extra mile to provide interactivity also benefit in terms of higher credibility ratings and reader satisfaction, which has implications for attracting and maintaining audiences (Chung, 2008; Kim, 2009). More importantly, the Web's participatory capacity offers users the chance to both provide, and expose themselves to, alternative points of view (McKenna and Bargh, 2000). As such, newspapers that treat readers as active participants rather than as consumers could be contributing to Gans\u2019 (2003) notion of \u201cmultiperspectival\u201d journalism that approaches the news from the bottom up, making a space for citizens\u2019 voices to be heard, and, ultimately, strengthening democracy.", "Scholars long have acknowledged that democracy and a free press go hand in hand (Dahl, 1998). The press has a responsibility to contribute to public discourse (Waisbord, 1996), and opening the gates to allow for online user participation is perhaps the twenty-first-century version of this duty. In fact, some scholars view online media and the inclusion of diverse voices as having the potential to strengthen freedom of the press in Latin America (Dizard, 2010), and Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, in a statement to the Committee on House Foreign Affairs in June 2010, said that citizen journalists and bloggers have stepped up in reaction to the repression of the press. As such, opening newspapers to allow citizens to actively participate in the news process, and potentially act as watchdogs, could bolster both freedom of expression and press freedom.", "Thus, the final research question this study will address is:  R Q5:\u2002Is press freedom in a country related to a newspaper's use of multimedia and participatory content?

While the flagship newspaper cannot alone account for the prevalence of multimedia and participatory features in any country's media industry, the chosen newspapers\u2014the most prominent and in most cases the ones with the highest circulation in each country (see Maddux, 2009)\u2014have the financial and journalistic means to adopt new technologies and interactive features.", "Given the cyclic variation of newspapers, the researchers chose to analyze a week's worth of content and selected one week in December to pool the data needed for the analysis. Starting on December 9, 2010, and for the next six days, the researchers visited each newspaper website and saved a copy of the homepages at the end of the day in each of the 19 countries, for a total of 132 files (Cuba's Granma did not have a Sunday edition). Both researchers, who are fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, coded for the presence of 14 web features on each newspaper's homepage (yes = 1; no = 0). These features were multimedia (i.e., versions for mobile devices, a digital copy of the day's print newspaper, blogs, RSS feeds, Twitter profile, Facebook page or similar, YouTube account, and video features), interactive (most popular/most read stories feature, and search function), and participatory (reporting errors feature, information to contact the editors/reporters, forums/chat rooms, and reader input via polls or citizen reports).", "Besides looking at the homepage overall, the coding scheme also called for an analysis of each article posted by 6 pm on the homepage that had a photo or some text accompanying the headline. These stories were selected because the inclusion of photo or text with the headline was an indication that these were the stories judged to embody the greatest news salience by the newspaper's gatekeepers. If the story led to an external domain (e.g., a different URL outside of the newspaper), it was excluded, as this was not content produced by the newspaper. This approach yielded 2304 stories, coded for story topic, byline, and the inclusion of another set of web features. The multimedia features were in-story hyperlinks (any link within the story text), external links (leading readers to pages with a different URL outside of the newspaper), links to related stories (labeled as such and apart from the story text), links to other articles by the same author, links to blogs, story tags, photos, videos, slide shows, audio clips or podcasts, and info-graphics.", "Regarding interactive features, the coding checked for the option to share the story via any social network, the possibility of sharing via email, a story-printing option and the Facebook \u201clike\u201d button. Participatory features coded were reader's comments, the author's email or contact information, the option to submit corrections to the story (e.g., giving users the chance to let the editors know about errors in the story, including forms and links for that explicit purpose), forums or chat rooms (e.g., inviting readers to discuss the story), uploading one's own photos/videos/audio, and editing options (i.e., the user could correct or update information, or add links to an existing story). Additionally, the coders counted the number of in-story links and related stories in each article, and whether videos posted were credited to newspaper staff, wire services or other sources.", "Preliminary inter-coder reliability analyses led the researchers to amend some of the coding instructions. After that, reliabilities as Cohen's kappa showed substantial agreement between both coders and ranged between 0.81 and 1.0.1 ", "Once the material was gathered, the data were processed to answer the research questions. Specifically for RQ3, the country's level of development was measured as the Human Development Index reported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2010.2 For RQ4, the numbers for Internet penetration rate in each country came from the Internet World Stats website (www.InternetWorldStats.com), and for RQ5 the authors used the ranking in Freedom House's (2010) press freedom index. All web features in the newspaper homepages and each of the individual stories were added and then averaged into an index in a weighted manner to compute a score of multimedia, interactive and participatory features present in the homepages and each of the analyzed stories. This way, a score of 1 represents a newspaper that included all of the homepage features and all the story features in every article, and a score of zero means that none of these web features were present. Each newspaper was ranked according to these scores."]}, {"title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["In answering RQ1, all the newspapers analyzed include some kind of multimedia, interactive and participatory features, although to a varying degree.

Hyperlinking in general was less frequent, as less than a fifth of the stories (17.4 percent) included an internal link and less than a tenth (8.4 percent) linked to external sources. On average, there were 0.61 in-story links, and articles about arts and entertainment were more likely to have links.

Every story in Costa Rica's La Naci\u00f3n and Brazil's Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, on the other hand, allowed readers to post comments.

Similarly, results were not significant for interactive features (r s=\u22120.12; ns), participatory features (r s=\u22120.06; ns), or the combined index with all web features (r s=0.27; ns).", "For RQ4, analyzing whether a country's Internet penetration rate is related to a newspaper's web content, findings show significant rank-order correlations between each country's Internet penetration rate and newspaper's use of multimedia elements significant (r s=0.52, p<0.05), and between the Internet rate and the combined index of all of a newspaper's web features (r s=0.50, p<0.05). Again, however, results were not significant for interactive features (r s=0.24; ns) or participatory features (r s=0.11; ns).", "In answer to RQ5, whether press freedom was related to web content, the rank-order correlations were non-significant and with coefficients close to zero, showing no relationship. This was the case for multimedia features (r s =0.03; ns), the interactive features (r s=\u22120.06; ns), and the participatory features (r s=0.03; ns), as well as a combined index with all web features (r s=\u22120.06; ns)."]}, {"title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["This content analysis of 19 online newspapers from throughout Latin America demonstrates that in general, newspapers include basic multimedia elements, but are slow to adopt more interactive and participatory features. Newspaper websites in Latin America, similar to news organizations in other Western countries, show little openness to citizens\u2019 input and contribution, reinforcing the findings of scholars like Hermida and Thurman (2008) and J\u00f6nsson and \u00d6rnebring (2011). Most newspapers, for example, encouraged users to share articles, offering multimedia elements that facilitated dissemination, whether through RSS feeds, social media buttons or the ability to send a story via email. However, when it came to actually soliciting input from readers, instead of simply allowing them to share the content, newspapers were more reticent. While three-fourths of newspaper stories included a space for reader comments, the ability to give feedback by contacting reporters or reporting errors was almost non-existent. Not a single newspaper allowed readers to edit stories or upload their own content directly. Following the model of Domingo et al. (2008), audiences do not have any real input prior to publication in the production process of the news they consume.", "Few Latin American newspapers took advantage of the multimedia and interactive potential of the Internet, as content mostly mirrored what would be found in a traditional print newspaper, lending support to other researchers who have found similar results in developed countries (Singer, 2005; Williams et al., 2011). For example, photos were published alongside most stories, but videos, audio clips, slideshows, and info-graphics were included in less than 10 percent of the stories analyzed. Further, less than a fifth of articles included links within the text of the story, and less than half included links to related stories, all of which indicates that these Latin American newspapers still are following a print-first mentality, adapting new technologies to fit with old practices, rather than embracing the potential for greater reader participation. Past research suggests that the inclusion of these web features may be a market strategy (e.g., Jenkins, 2006; Vujnovic et al., 2010), and given that web traffic may offset declining circulation, it is surprising that the newspaper websites analyzed missed the opportunity to capitalize on citizen inclusion in the news production process.", "Development and press freedom were not significantly correlated with any of the indices, which arguably could hint at the idea that there are more macro and micro factors at play. Economic development throughout Latin America and even within specific countries is uneven, but so too are the resources available to newspapers which would allow them to optimize their uses of new technologies. As such, it makes sense that results showed no significant relationship between development and a newspaper's use of web features, but a significant correlation existed between Internet penetration rates and a newspaper's use of multimedia features. Such a finding reinforces the idea that newspapers are cognizant of the digital divide, offering only those multimedia elements which they believe their audiences will be able to access. For example, in Cuba, where communications technologies are severely lacking and few citizens have Internet access, the newspaper Granma includes few web elements. Similarly, La Raz\u00f3n in Bolivia, a resource-poor country with little Internet access, also offers little in the way of multimedia or interactivity. In contrast, in a country like Uruguay, which has one of the highest Internet penetration rates in Latin America, the newspaper El Pa\u00eds provided a downloadable podcast of every single story. As such, these Latin American newspapers seem to be responding to the realities of digital exclusion in their respective countries, offering web features according to availability of digital resources. Further illustrating this concept is the way newspapers, when they did offer video, relied heavily on ready-made YouTube videos or those from other networks, rather than spending the resources to produce their own.", "Thus, while a newspaper's use of multimedia web features has less to do with development and press freedom than with Internet penetration rates and technological resources available, these findings are important for offering insight into the crossroads between print and digital journalism in a region largely ignored in scholarly research. Findings indicate that while these newspapers in Latin America are willing to incorporate new technologies on a most basic level, they still have not adjusted their news routines to make the most of the ever-expanding digital toolbox. As such, findings seem to suggest that newspapers are adapting technologies to fit traditional print practices, rather than evolving to fit better within a digital realm. Additionally, newspapers seem to be limiting what web features they do offer to those that allow users to interact only on a superficial basis. While readers can share stories via Facebook, Twitter or email, there is little opportunity for them to make a significant input, again demonstrating newspapers\u2019 adherence to the standard one-way, top-down approach to news reporting. Thus, these Latin American newspapers are in essence unlocking the gates, but keeping them mostly closed. This mirrors the US and European research of Domingo et al. (2008) who found that, in general, newspapers do not invite citizens into the news production process.", "In an era of social media and blogs, with newspapers struggling to maintain readers and advertising, these Latin American newspapers that are failing to offer truly participatory content are perhaps hurting themselves by keeping readers at bay. As studies suggest the possibility that including interactive elements can positively benefit newspapers, these Latin American publications may be missing out on readers and advertising. As such, these newspapers should perhaps consider ways to bring more citizen voices into the online newsroom, promoting two-way, bottom-up engagement with readers. Such inclusion of citizen voices could allow diverse, alternative views to gain prominence, perhaps ultimately strengthening democratic debate and thus democracy itself.", "This study is limited as it includes just one newspaper from each country, and uses only one week of content. Nevertheless, such research is important as it provides a thorough account of web content at flagship newspapers in a developmentally and culturally distinct region outside of traditional communication research.", "Moving forward, similar research in digitally diverse countries should continue. For example, future studies should consider increasing the sample size to include more media and more countries. Also, qualitative research, such as interviews, could tap into newsroom practices, editorial policies, and the gatekeeping decisions made as to which stories get which multimedia elements, and how newspapers decide the extent of user participation that they will allow.", "As this study indicates, these Latin American newspapers have made only slight incursions into the Web 2.0 era, characterized by interactivity and user participation. Their limited strides suggest that the digital divide plays a role in the extent of web features which a newspaper offers. Until digital access and know-how become more widespread, newspapers might not find it worthwhile in a cost\u2013benefit analysis to provide multimedia content or open the gates of the newspaper to allow participation from users who might never even log onto a newspaper's website. Thus, newspapers are faced with the challenge of deciding whether they are willing to forego their traditional role as gatekeepers and embrace the interactive potential of the Internet, or whether they will remain static, clinging to traditional print practices and philosophies in a digital world."]}], "references": [{"title": "The Internet and Knowledge Gaps: a theoretical and empirical investigation", "year": "2002", "journal": "European Journal of Communication", "volume": "17", "authors": [{"name": "Bonfadelli Heinz", "first_name": "Bonfadelli", "last_name": "Heinz"}]}, {"title": "Interactive Features of Online Newspapers: identifying patterns and predicting use of engaged readers", "year": "2008", "journal": "Journal of Computer-mediated Communication", "volume": "13", "authors": [{"name": "Chung Deborah S.", "first_name": "Chung", "last_name": "S."}]}, {"title": "Finally Informing the Electorate?
