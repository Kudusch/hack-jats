This largely reflects the emergence of a raft of new titles which appeal to more populist tastes and which do not conform to traditional journalistic ethical values. As a consequence there has been both popular debate about the legitimacy of these techniquesand legislation aimed at curbing their excesses. This paper explores the rise of these magazines and their social effects. ", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The magazine market in Spain is growing. The number of titles is multiplying rapidly, while both circulation figures and advertising income have reached record heights as the number of readers increases.", "According to data derived from Estudio General de Medios (EGM; General Media Survey)1 the magazine audience in 2003 stood at 18,714,033 readers, 53.1 per cent of the population and a 4.6 per cent increase on the previous year. This trend has continued so that during the period between October 2004 and May 2005, the overall magazine audience reached 55 per cent, or 20,386,000 readers.", "EGM's list accounts for 137 titles, which are classified by frequency (weekly, fortnightly, monthly) and according to the topics dealt with\u2014women's magazines, the gossip press, men's magazines and specialised topics such as decoration, sciences, computing, engines, music and so on.", "In the same manner, we may also perceive how investment in magazine advertising has increased. According to information gathered by Infoadex2 (an organisation which periodically assesses advertising investments in all communication media), magazine investment grew by 6.4 per cent between January and June 2003 year on year, reaching 312.7 million euros. This rising trend continues and magazines currently rank third in the media, with 10.8 per cent of overall media investment, behind the indisputable leaders which are television (40.8 per cent) and the daily newspapers (26.9 per cent).", "So far as circulation is concerned, the Oficina de Justificaci\u00f3n de la Difusi\u00f3n3 (OJD; Audit Bureau of Circulation) claims that Spain sold an average of 12,635,786 copies in 2003, and in this context it is worth mentioning that 2004 was a year characterised by significant launches in the Spanish market and relevant events such as Crown Prince Felipe's marriage, which had the effect of increasing the number of copies sold.", "Having established these basic facts, we will focus on a particular segment which stands out among the others: gossip magazines. The last few years have witnessed a striking growth of this type of magazine, and, as will be further seen, they are the leaders of the three aspects which have already been mentioned. The figures in Table 1 speak for themselves about this phenomenon occurring in Spain (the categories of \u201cpopulist\u201d and \u201cupmarket\u201d for gossip titles are explained below). ", "As we may notice, there are six gossip magazines among the 10 titles which were most widely read in 2004 and 2005, accounting for 13,000,000 people who admit reading these magazines on a weekly basis.", "Among those magazines gathering greater investments, those for women stand out. Being monthly as they are, the leading position is for weekly gossip magazines (Table 2). ", "The two leading Spanish magazines in terms of circulation are Pronto and Hola, as can be appreciated from Table 3. The others are way behind. Both of these magazines have been in a leading position for several years. Three other titles (Lecturas, Que Me Dices and Diez Minutos) are among the 10 listed in Table 1; all of these have increased or maintained their circulation whereas the rest of the magazines in other categories face declining circulation. "]}, {"title": "Origin and Evolution", "paragraphs": ["Gossip magazines, also known as \u201ccelebrity magazines\u201d based on \u201cpersonality journalism\u201d (as in the United States), are increasingly popular in Spain with readers who are interested in learning about the lifestyles of celebrities. The origin of gossip magazines can be traced back to the 17th century, when salon chroniclers devoted their time to describing what happened in aristocratic ballrooms. This information would later become regarded as a reflection of society, and would then evolve into our current gossip publications, describing celebrities\u2019 lives. They became an established genre in the 1960s, coinciding with the last years of Franco's dictatorship, a moment in which the model of women championed at the time began to change. The real revolution did not arrive until 1986 when a massive inflow of foreign press groups entered Spain. The Law of Foreign Investments in publishing companies, promulgated in 1982, drew the attention to Spanish magazines devoted to women (Gallego, 1990, p. 71).", "Television programming has supported the rise of these magazines; 1993 brought us the first gossip journal on television, Coraz\u00f3n, coraz\u00f3n, managed and presented by Cristina Garc\u00eda Ramos. After this programme, several others were shown on television with contents ranging from formal accounts of the lives of famous people, specially members of the royal family or film stars, to talk shows and informal broadcasts which lack the informative rigour which had once characterised this type of press. Talk shows allowed information aimed solely at awakening peoples\u2019 excessive fascination in others\u2019 lives and increasing audience share. Among these programmes are \u00a1Qu\u00e9 me dices! (Channel 5 [Telecinco], 1995), Salsa Rosa (Channel 3 [Antena 3], 2002), T\u00f3mbola (independent channels, 1997) and Aqu\u00ed hay tomate (Channel 5 [Telecinco], 2003). Another novelty will come with the digital versions of print magazines."]}, {"title": "Reader Profile", "paragraphs": ["There are over 15 million people who read (or at least have a look at) these types of magazines. According to EGM readers are mainly women (between 60 and 70 per cent) who describe themselves as housewives, are married, have average-to-high purchasing power, living in big or medium-sized cities."]}, {"title": "Features", "paragraphs": ["Before analysing the gossip press, it is necessary to distinguish its characteristics to determine what is actually understood by the term. Authors such as Juana Gallego (1990) make a distinction between the gossip press and the press for women even though the former is specifically aimed at women. However, it is generally considered a new press modality incorporating specialised topics. The reasons put forward to support the idea that these magazines are specially aimed at women, are found in the following characteristics (Gallego, 1990, p. 102):  They are written in a feminine style, in a friendly and intimate tone.   They include appealing topics for women, such as home improvement, love and beauty but we will see that other topics take priority which creates the difference with women's magazines.   The advertisements found in gossip magazines are intended mainly for women.   The readership of gossip magazines is, by a considerable margin, predominantly made up of women.

Their major aim is to publish these people's private lives, especially any detail concerning their privacy.   Most contents deal with the most confidential information about people with a certain public importance (their lives, love affairs, successes, failures), without forgetting the details of their everyday activities and where they spend their summer holidays.   The text in these magazines is secondary and normally complements the photography.

By public celebrity we mean a distinguished person, \u201canyone who is worth tracking\u201d (Gallego, 1990, p. 103). To this we must add the new type of celebrity offered by current television programmes\u2014the great explosion of gossip in print and on screen has demanded new faces related to television programmes such as Big Brother, Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo or any similar type of programme. People who are not themselves famous but are related to famous people also fit in this category.", "Gallego establishes three groups of famous people, categorised according to their recurrence in the media: ephemeral, sporadic and assiduous. The different people appearing in the media have been added to this classification, including those of the new generation.  Those who are ephemeral appear once in the media due to an occasional event in which he or she took part. This will be the single time the media refers to him or her, and journalists will no longer run after them. The following people may be placed under the ephemeral category:  People who narrate their personal experiences, especially if they are tragic ones;   Those who involuntarily awaken media interest by having been involved in a news event.       Sporadic people are those who appear in the media in separate spaces of time.  Within this group we may include the new generation of famous people, associated with the new television programmes. Many of them remain in this category, but others become \u201cassiduous\u201d. This is the case of the young pop stars who owe their success to the television programme Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (Pop Stars) in which they participated.   Acquaintances, friends, lovers or relatives of the famous person, also belong to this group. The interest they arouse is absolutely subordinated to their connection with the famous people. Without this connection they would not have anything interesting to offer; this is why they continuously provoke pieces of gossip news with their comments or accounts, which are often invented. Some of these have also become \u201cassiduous\u201d (mothers of bullfighters\u2019 children, such as Bel\u00e9n Esteban, singers\u2019 ex wives, such as Isabel Preysler, etc.).   Famous people who avoid being the centre of attention and are only spotted by the cameras on certain occasions also belong in this section.      The assiduous are those who are always the journalists\u2019 major objective. There is one necessary condition to belong to this group: both the magazine and the famous person must have an interest in publishing. Magazine requirements to become one of the \u201cassiduous\u201d have changed over time. The number of people magazines have as objectives is increasing continuously and if they were once interested in the aristocracy, the net has spread to film stars, pop stars, actors and actresses, theatre directors, and in a further stage, interest also reached television stars (presenters, actors, etc.), musicians and singers, dancers, writers, artists, designers, architects, sportsmen, bullfighters, models, humorists, journalists, men of religion, businessmen and politicians.

In chronological order from date of launch they are: Lecturas, Semana, Hola and Diez Minutos. All are weekly, first appeared around the 1940s and are published on Thursdays. To this select group we must add Gala, launched in 2004. These magazines are characterised by publishing easy-to-read articles, with many illustrations and brief texts which can be quickly read. Some of the texts, as we will later see, are more elaborated than others. These magazines reveal the private lives of celebrities: their stories, love affairs, successes, failures, their dressing style, or what they say. Sometimes, the magazines do not even tell a story, they simply show some everyday routine\u2014a walk, the sport being practised, normal shopping\u2014or how they are\u2014the clothes they use, the car they have, if they study or work, or just where they go. All these people share similar characteristics: they are famous, generally young (or at any rate they do not seem to grow old), attractive, or at least elegant, and who, of course, enjoy a wonderful life. Problems for them are occasional and they have a lot of money and power, which enables them to enjoy all types of facilities (Gallego, 1990, pp. 110\u201317).", "In general, these magazines contain similar information which may be divided into three main segments. First of all, material produced in-house, secondly, up-to-date information coming from agencies, and thirdly, set sections dealing with fashion, beauty, kitchen recipes, travel, leisure, TV guides, star signs, pastimes and jokes. The last mentioned occupy just a couple of pages in the magazines.", " Lecturas was the first magazine to appear, in June 1921, as a supplement of El Hogar y la Moda (Home and Fashion), a magazine for women. It was successful as it allowed women to offer their opinion on any article shown in it or any other current topic of the time. The most relevant issues of the week were summarised, all of them about assiduous famous people. Then came the articles, being more important for their illustrations and photographs (many of them large and in colour) than for the text itself (brief and redundant). The rest of the sections were: Details (an article), The Enquirer (questions and answers about a current event), La imagen (a paradisaical place), Witness (the life of a famous person), TV Guide, People (going over famous peoples\u2019 doings and weekly activities), Curiosities (articles on several curious facts), Forges\u2019 jokes, and final sections on Fashion, Beauty, Health, Leisure, Travelling, Ideas, Horoscopes, Pastimes and Recipes.", " Semana emerged in February 1940. Its contents were not regarded as gossip at first, because they were mainly political or cultural. It changed in 1969 when Luis G. de Linares became its director and the focus shifted to royal events and shows. Its sections are People (news about famous people), Recipes, Fashion, Health, Leisure, Getaways (proposing places to visit), Horoscopes, Pastimes, Novelties, TV Guide, and Humour. It has long interviews and articles with numerous pictures.", " \u00a1HOLA! was launched in September 1944 (Angeletti and Oliva, 2002, pp. 324\u201361). It is also published in other countries, for example the United Kingdom. Because it is presented in a larger format than the other magazines, the quality of finish is better. It is characterised by its long illustrated reports, well crafted and with lots of large-sized photographs that sometimes occupy entire pages. The design is as carefully considered and crafted as the informative content, and celebrities are approached with a respectful attitude. Apart from illustrated reports on celebrities, it offers the following sections: Singular World (strange events around the planet), Pastimes, News Cocktail (varied information about famous people), Cinema (current premieres and actors), Seven Days (news in brief about famous people), Panorama (world news in images), Famous peoples\u2019 holidays (summer section), Society (social acts), Television, TV News (information about TV stars), Fashion, Beauty and Recipes.", " Diez Minutos appeared in September 1951. It is the last magazine to survive Franco's regime and its success was due to its section Estos d\u00edas se habla\u2026 (weekly review of brief pieces of news). Front of book articles are the longest, becoming shorter as the magazine progresses. In it we also find Fotos diez (peculiar images), Pastimes, Beauty, Fashion, Healthcare, Leisure, Ideas, Recipes, TV Guide, Tendencies, Letters, Horoscopes and Humour.", " Gala was created in October 2004, together with Diva, both publishing on Mondays. Recently, it has been published on Thursdays in order to share publication day with the upmarket gossip magazines. We owe its arrival to an agreement between G\u200a+\u200aJ, which edits this magazine in France, and Vocento (Saiz, 2004, p. 4). Its design is very distinctive, the photographs dominate the pages and sometimes even occupy two pages. Contents can be summarised as: Current affairs (relevant article of the week), Beauty, Recipes, Agenda (cultural events), Finery (events which have famous people as protagonists), Divine and Human (society chronicles), Focus (famous peoples\u2019 news), Pastimes and Horoscopes.", "Upmarket gossip magazines, unlike the populist sector which publishes on Mondays, rely on some strict rules delineated by Antonio S\u00e1nchez G\u00f3mez (Angeletti and Oliva, 2002, p. 352), the founder of \u00a1Hola! (Hello!):  Pictures of topless women, or naked people in general, will not be published.   Photographs are highly valued. Without images there is no story, photographs tell the story.   Interesting copy must accompany the image: \u201cPhotographs must speak for themselves and show something which might awaken the reader's interest\u201d.   Photographs and other material must be current and authentic. Pieces of gossip and speculation which might negatively affect the interviewed people will not be published. All information used must be confirmed or verified.   Copy must be short, except for cover stories which are longer, better and serious.   People are more important than things or topics. Protagonists must be well-known or related to an important event. Stories of human interest prevail, specially those dealing with moments of joy.   Never criticise people. Items of news must be fun, pleasant and never aggressive towards the person who has been interviewed. This feature distinguishes them from Monday magazines, aimed at excessive speculation about the topics dealt with. The founder of \u00a1Hola! considers that his magazine runs journalism of opinion, but does not produce any subjective or personal value judgements.

However, they have gained many readers, to the extent that Pronto is the most read magazine in Spain. According to Gallego, it is because they deliberately mix fiction and reality, and they also \u201cput people down and stop idolising them, using an iconoclastic and insolent style\u201d (1990, p. 111). Gallego points out that they may be bought just to see the resourceful inventiveness used to present the information. She takes for granted that readers know the material is fictitious, but they still read the pages in search of fiction with real characters.", "There are four Monday magazines: Pronto, \u00a1Qu\u00e9 me dices!, Sorpresa, and Diva; although Diva does not completely fulfil the characteristics pointed out previously. It first emerged as a gossip magazine but has been transformed into a magazine for women, trying to find its place in this market sector. Its page format is also different (33\u00d723.5 cm), like those of \u00a1Hola! and Gala, and larger than the rest of the populist gossip magazines (29.5\u00d721 cm).", " Pronto features the proper characteristics of a Monday magazine\u2014it is not as interested in the copy and photographs as it is in attracting readers\u2019 attention. The information in this magazine serves a different purpose, it tries to show readers the other life of the rich and famous by dealing with topics such as famous people in prison, the rebirth of former idols, a millionaire's ruin or imprisonment. It differs from other magazines because it includes stories sent in by anonymous contributors. There are four types of stories: Un hecho real, El amor no tiene edad, Vivencias and \u00bfQu\u00e9 habr\u00eda sido de mi vida? (A real story, Love has no age, Experiences and What would have happened if...?). Apart from these stories there are updated articles on drugs, environmental problems, and natural tragedies. It also has set sections: Your rights (readers ask questions and the magazine offers answers), Pastimes, Curiosities (surprising events), Healthcare (sanitary advice), Pronto's new pharmacy, Tips (home advice), Beauty, Interesting lives (famous people's stories), Competition, TV Guide, Horoscopes and Current affairs (news in brief about the famous people),", " \u00a1Qu\u00e9 me dices! was first published in 1997 as a consequence of the television programme shown on Channel 5 (Telecinco) and named after it. It deals with the same current affairs as any other gossip magazine, but unlike upmarket ones its tone is more informal and it even laughs at or criticises famous people. However, it does not go as far as the magazine Sorpresa! in this respect. The magazine is divided between People (with the weekly articles) and the set sections. These comprise Fashion, Beauty, Bazaar (peculiar objects, price and place where they may be purchased), Family life (tips), Rights, Pastimes, Horoscopes, Recipes, Health, Diet, Travel, Fate's desire (personal stories sent by readers), Agenda (cultural pieces of news), Current affairs (famous people's news) and Visto lo visto (a contest with the most controversial photos of the week and questions about them; the questionnaire mocks the famous people in the photos).", " Sorpresa! came out in 1998. It is the most sensationalist of all the magazines, with headlines calculated to shock the reader. Its pages ruin the good image of the famous people presented in Thursday magazines. They are criticised, pestered and laughed at. Together with the weekly articles, there are set sections: Se dice se comenta (they say and comment), a review of the weekly news of famous people, Women's charms (fashion tips), Television (TV guide), Kitchen tips, Peculiarities (more tips for the house, health), The X-ray (offering detailed information about a famous person), The Magic corner (several peculiarities) and Tachycardia (striking news of famous people, most of them aimed at making them appear ridiculous).", " Diva emerged in October 2004 together with Gala, the latter now comes out on Thursdays instead of Mondays. Diva, despite maintaining the day on which it comes out, has recently changed its contents. It first appeared as a gossip magazine, which is why it is included in this study. However, its contents are now those of a mainstream woman's magazine, only varying in certain interviews which are gossip-like. This magazine was launched by Hola and there were initial attempts to create publishing agreements with Hachette Filipacchi and Edipresse Hymasa, but they failed. It seemed as though Diva emerged as a response to Gala, but its publishers maintain that they had been long working on the Diva project (Saez, 2004, p. 4).", "Monday magazines share similar characteristics and differ from Thursday ones, even in the cheaper price. Their design, photographs and articles are not of equal quality to those found in upmarket gossip magazines. They do not show respect towards famous people, and do not regard them as different from other mortals; this is precisely their reason to criticise and mock. The following are the general features of these magazines as opposed to Thursday ones:  They publish pictures of both topless women and naked men. These are not just seen in the inside pages, but on the cover as well, or even in their advertisements.   There must be an interesting story to tell, but if it generates a crazed fascination, all the better. Photographs must give rise to sensationalist headlines.   Photographs and other material must be authentic, but some of these magazines make use of fictitious copy or unconfirmed data. Even though they generally work on current topics, sometimes they recycle copy from their archive.   The priority of the copy is not to be of good quality and serious, but rather to cause an impact on the reader. Articles are normally brief and aimed at interpreting the photographs that go with them, they are the real focus.   Even though famous people are still the core of these publications, they are no longer idolised. They are secondary, because the main goal is drawing readers\u2019 attention. Monday magazines are not interested in humane stories, but rather in those filled with controversy, messy affairs (separations, insults, unfaithfulness, naked bodies) and so on.   The motto of never criticizing famous people is completely forgotten and abandoned. Criticism and direct confrontation between people are favoured and encouraged.

It is important to bear in mind that magazines about famous people's private lives have become extremely popular in a short time. They have larger print runs than cultural or generalist publications.", "This eagerness to make public what belongs in the private sphere is not just exclusive to famous people. Normal anonymous people are now making their story (disappointment in love, tragedies, separations, paternities) public in this type of magazine in exchange for a certain amount of money. These accounts are among the most widely read content.", "Since the Middle Ages the Spanish have been experts, sensitive and well aware of the concept of honour, at defending personal reputation; we have risked a lot and we have been violent in the name of honour. But as a whole, we were not very conscious of the idea of privacy and private life. If once this was the clich\u00e9, nowadays Spanish people are well aware of their privacy, and we give it away when we wish to do so.", "According to Carlos Soria (1992), director of the Ethics and Right to Information Department at the University of Navarra, Spain has been through, in a short time, a \u201cnational master's degree in privacy assault\u201d. Among these assaults or breaches of privacy, he identified the following modalities:  Privacy breaches proceeding from chromosomes (the Athletics Federation's doubts about the sex of an athlete).   Privacy breaches proceeding from air or sea, taking a light aircraft and flying 100 metres above the country house of some famous banker or actor.

If the person doing any of the previously mentioned actions is an authority or a civil servant, the punishment would be greater (Article 198, Spanish Penal Code).", "Within the privacy field, we may distinguish four types of punishable conduct:  Taking possession of papers, letters, electronic messages, and personal documents or belongings.

The first instance includes the concept of protected privacy; the data have been obtained lawfully, or the person who spreads the information ignores any unlawful procedures which have been used to obtain it. The second case accounts for the media or the journalists who are aware of unlawful procedures. In the first case there is a public interest in knowing this information, despite the fact it belongs to someone's privacy. There is therefore a justification. The second case is by no means justifiable, not even with the presence of a public interest.", "This gives rise to a question concerning the communication media: whether this rule will still allow the denunciation and revelation of punishable acts and irregularities carried out by politicians, when on many occasions the information derives from the irregularities of a civil servant who photocopies and sends a document to the media, or takes it despite the fact that it has been stolen or obtained by another unlawful procedure.", "The current deontological code, accepted by most professional associations is as follows:  Celebrities or famous people must accept the fact that information about their acts will be published, due to their public condition.
