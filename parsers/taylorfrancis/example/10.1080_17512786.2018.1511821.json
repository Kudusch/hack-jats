However, several organizational and individual factors may affect the extent to which news outlets adopt social media innovations. In particular, there is assumed to be a divide among different age groups of journalists in embracing social media. Utilizing a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, the study seeks to understand how social media culture in newsrooms affects journalists\u2019 strategies of taking social media as an innovation, and how journalists of different age groups differ in the SEM model fit. The analyses indicated Twitter engagement mediates social media culture and journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media. However, that was not the case with Facebook. Additionally, while younger journalists favored Twitter, older journalists embraced Facebook and middle-aged journalists adopted both Facebook and Twitter. The analyses showed the more that middle-aged journalists interacted on Twitter, the more they tended to have a positive attitude toward social media. However, the more that younger and older journalists engaged on Twitter, the more they tended to have a negative attitude toward social media. Journalists from all three age groups tended to hold a negative attitude toward social media if they engaged more on Facebook.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In the transition from traditional to digital news outlets, engagement via social media is being adopted by more and more news organizations as a strategy to confront with declining revenue (Heravi and Harrower 2016; Bentivegna and Marchetti 2018; Brems et al. 2017). Media organizations have embraced social media as a way to distribute news and connect with audiences, providing a range of mechanisms for users to share and recommend news content (Singer et al. 2011; Beckett and Deuze 2016). Individual journalists have incorporated social media into daily routines in the news diffusion process\u2014to share content, develop relationships and build community (Farhi 2009; Neilson 2018). Social media in particular are used as a strategy to appeal to news organizations\u2019 young audiences, whom news organizations have found hard to reach over traditional news distribution channels.", "The integration of social media as an innovation in the news production process increases the audience reach of newsrooms. An innovation is the implementation of invention in a market or a social setting (Fagerberg 2004). The four types of innovation identified by Francis and Bessant (2005)\u2014product, process, position and paradigmatic innovation\u2014can be transferred to innovation in the media industry as new media platforms, new business models and new ways of producing media text (Storsul and Krumsvik 2013; Arbatani, Asadi, and Omidi 2018). In particular, social media as an innovation can be applied as process innovation. For example, news diffusion via social media is based on the idea that journalists\u2019 posts may influence an exceptional number of their followers (Trusov, Bodapati, and Bucklin 2010). A study of the diffusion of news on Twitter found that a message from a news organization or journalist was reposted on average 15.5 times (An et al. 2011).", "Despite the fact that social media as an innovation\u2014to increase engagement and reduce news production cost\u2014has been widely recognized, the integration of social media in newsrooms ranges at various levels. One potential factor is age. In the general population, age has been identified as a highly significant predictor of Internet Connectedness Index among factors such as income, education, gender, and study area (Loges and Jung 2001), and is often perceived as an important variable influencing uses of new communication technologies (Gulyas 2013). Likewise, the Social Media Fact Sheet released by the Pew Research Center (2018), found that as of January 10, 2018, roughly two-thirds of U.S. adults (68%) reported they are Facebook users. Furthermore, about 88% of U.S. adults aged 18\u201329, 78% aged 30\u201349, 64% aged 50\u201364, and 37% aged 65 years or older use at least one social media site (PewResearchCenter 2018). This data shows journalists may reach a large audience by adopting social media as an innovative journalistic tool for distributing stories on social media, particularly to reach younger audiences.", "Similar to the findings in the digital divide among younger and older American adults (Lenhart 2000), social media as an innovation may be affected by individual journalists\u2019 various characteristics. For instance, age was recognized by Spyridou et al. (2013) as the only significant factor that influences their social media strategy\u2014either expelling or embracing social media as a strategy for innovation. Spyridou et al.\u2019s (2013) findings regarding age demand a closer look into the age differences in the use of and attitudes towards social media among journalists.", "Although previous researchers in the fields of media and communication studies have proposed that an age-based divide exists in journalists\u2019 adoption of social media as an innovation, few studies have conducted empirical research on the correlation between journalists\u2019 age and social media use, particularly in the types of social media that are used. To fill in the gaps in our knowledge\u2014how journalists\u2019 social media use and attitude toward social media are affected by age\u2014this study seeks to understand how young journalists (age\u2009\u2264\u200930), middle-aged (31\u2009\u2264\u2009age\u2009\u2264\u200949), and older journalists (\u226550) differ in the adoption of social media and the difference of the integration of social media in their daily routines. Utilizing a SEM analysis, the study seeks to understand (1) how social media culture in newsrooms affects journalists\u2019 strategies of taking social media as an innovation, in particular social media engagement and their attitude toward social media, and (2) how journalists of different age groups differ in the SEM model fit."]}, {"title": "Literature Review", "paragraphs": ["Journalism is in a state of flux\u2014undergoing dramatic changes due to the impact of social media. As a result, practitioners and researchers have advocated for social journalism\u2014the integration of social media in journalistic practices (Hermida 2012; Endo 2013), where journalists take on the role of curators, whose primary function is to contextualize the data on social media (Hermida 2012). The impact of social media on journalism is far-reaching and widespread, ranging from news gathering to production and distribution; as a result, many commentators claim that journalism is undergoing a fundamental transformation.", "News organizations\u2019 structures and cultures were recognized as important factors that influence journalists\u2019 professional ideologies and behaviors. Paulussen and Ugille (2008) assumed both the organizational structure and professional culture of a newsroom foster or hinder media innovations. Heravi and Harrower (2016) held journalism as a profession with a specific occupational ideology and culture. The newsroom as a social system shapes what journalists do (Breed 1955; Tuchman 1978; Schudson 2003). In addition, organizational structure was found to play an important role in shaping journalists\u2019 adoption of innovations (Boczkowski 2004). Moreover, in digital transitions, younger journalists were found to believe in greater structural changes resulting in greater transparency and media control as well as dialogical opportunities (Spyridou et al. 2013).The diffusion of innovations may be hindered by cultural and technological differences in approaches to newsgathering and dissemination, as well as by a lack of training to alleviate concerns about the perceived complexities of new media formats (Singer 2004). The ability to quickly change the flow of information within an organization, including business strategy and policy, to make the innovation align with organizational infrastructure (Mathiassen and Pries-Heje 2006) is an important factor that affects the success of newsroom innovations.", "News organizations tend to embrace, standardize and formalize many of the news production and distribution norms and practices at the management level in order to nurture a newsroom culture or context. Previous studies have found that the management structure of a news organization affects its culture. It was revealed that journalists\u2019 autonomy depends on the interactions between news executives, editors, and reporters in specific newsrooms (Ryfe 2009). Punishments and rewards can be established to help ensure certain organizationally sanctioned behaviors (Lowrey 2006). For example, to establish equilibrium in newsrooms, authorities, identified as mostly publishers use reward and punishment prudently (Reese and Ballinger 2001).", "As Deuze and Witschge (2018) advocated, to understand the instability inside the news industry, it is important to go \u2018beyond journalism\u2019 to have a broader view about what journalism is, and what journalists should be. Domingo (2008) proposed to examine the dynamic relationship between technology, social actors and contextual factors, and acknowledged that any development in new media is the consequence of decisions made in specific newsrooms in particular circumstances by journalists that have a professional culture, knowledge and expectations about the Internet as a news medium. The dominant journalistic culture\u2014as articulated in journalists\u2019 attitudes, professional values and perceptions of their audience\u2014plays an important role in the journalists\u2019 use of new technologies (Singer 1997). A survey of journalists in Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom concluded that media sector and size of organization are important factors that affect journalists\u2019 use and views about social media (Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton 2012).", "Engaging with audiences not only serves newsrooms\u2019 civic duty, but also possibly reduces news organizations\u2019 production costs. Audience is regarded as an economic capital and symbolic capital in digital journalism (Tandoc 2014). Social media engagement may act as an economic force due to the characteristics of social media: easy access to (1) online activities, (2) online forums, and (3) real-time statistics (Johnson and Hyysalo 2012).", "Social media has been used by journalists as a news-gathering, promotional, and a networking tool. Broersma and Graham (2012) found Twitter is \u201ca cheap, quick and easy to work beat\u201d for getting information and has turned into a promising virtual sphere for journalists\u2019 news and information sources. Industry surveys suggested that social media have become part of the everyday toolkit of journalists (Oriella PR Network 2012). Social media is considered a hybrid component of the promotional mix (Mangold and Faulds 2009). Lee, Lindsey, and Kim (2017) found that journalists may instantly disperse their work directly to their audiences on social media. For example, Twitter is regarded as a powerful tool in information sharing (Kwak et al. 2010). Hermida (2012) found two-thirds of online media users value sharing content, and the figure was even higher among young adults, among whom 83% value the sharing of content. News organizations facilitate the dissemination of news by encouraging users to \u201clike\u201d or \u201ctweet\u201d a story on social media (Singer et al. 2011). A survey of television newsrooms indicated journalists regularly post links to their news stories on Facebook to promote their stories (Vis 2013).", "Attitudes can be inferred from cognitive responses and may influence an individual\u2019s behavior. Attitudes can be categorized into positive, negative or neutral attitudes (Ajzen 2005). In general, positive correlations were found between engagement and attitudes toward the object of the beliefs (Ajzen and Sexton 1999). In particular, Gangadharbatla\u2019s (2008) study found user\u2019s self-efficacy is positively related to their attitudes toward social media. Likewise, Gulyas\u2019 (2013) found a positive correlation between UK journalists\u2019 social media engagement and their positive attitudes toward social media.", "A divide was found between veteran and young journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media. Tensions between veteran and young journalists fresh from school in adopting social media as an innovation were recognized in newsrooms (Carlson and Lewis 2015). Journalists from the oldest group of respondents are more reluctant to accept the innovation and use social media as an important channel\u2014less than half of journalists in this category (48%) believe in the journalistic relevance of social media (Raeymaeckers et al. 2016). Many older journalists expressed anxiety about their jobs and their fear that younger reporters straight out of university would have access to stories that they were unable to find because of their lack of technical know-how (Phillips 2015). Furthermore, journalists\u2019 cognitive self-efficacy about social media may affect their attitude towards social media. For instance, Lee (2015) discovered the influences of journalists\u2019 social media activities on journalists\u2019 perceptions of journalism and social media.", "In this study, the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory is used to help understand the process innovations of social media\u2013how social media are being integrated into the news production processes, and, in consequence, how these social media engagement processes affect journalists\u2019 attitudes toward social media. DOI explains how an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among members of a social system (Rogers Everett 1995). For example, the adoption of innovation was found to be accelerated when initiated by opinion leaders (Valente and Davis 1999). Technology is one of the main drivers of media innovation. In the history of entrepreneurship and innovation, upon the challenges of new media technologies, it is typical for media professionals and entrepreneurs to jointly create an environment where the key professionals lead the movement, giving entrepreneurship a voice (Boczkowski and Rodriguez-Giralt 2017). Likewise, social media as a strategy of innovation is being adopted by more and more media professionals and entrepreneurs in newsrooms.", "Social media, as an innovation, have been updated constantly based on technological innovations. At the same time, social media are being used as a strategy of innovation to transform new digital technologies into reality, specifically, as a way to tap into market potential or business model (Westlund and Lewis 2014; Ratten 2017; Arbatani, Asadi, and Omidi 2018). Social media have changed the innovation processes, the exploration and exploitation of opportunities that result in new products or services (Lomborg and Helles 2013; Dogruel 2014; Sigala and Chalkiti 2015). Utterback (1974) stated that the adoption and diffusion of an innovation was found to be largely dependent on communication of ideas and problem solving: \u201cany firm\u2019s potential for technical innovation can be considered as a function of its environment, including social factors and information about technology\u201d (p. 642). Similarly, a newsroom\u2019s environment may not only affect journalists\u2019 adoption of social media as an innovation, but also the diffusion of its product\u2014social news.", "Based on Utterback\u2019s (1974) findings, it seems the adoption of social media as an innovation depending to a greater extent on communication with technical personnel inside newsrooms. Therefore, it is valuable to delve into the status of social media diffusion in newsrooms, and how social media culture\u2014the context of social media in propelling the change\u2014affects journalists\u2019 social media strategy; in consequence, how age affects multiple journalists groups in adopting social media strategies, and their perceptions of and attitudes toward social media in newsrooms.", "In contemporary newsrooms, despite the popularity of social media use among young adults and the adoption of social media among journalists of all ages, the differences between young journalists and old journalists in adopting social media has not been fully understood.", "Previous studies found that young and emerging adults are more likely to use social media (Hughes et al. 2012). Journalists in their 20s and 30s tend to adopt social media and are more engaged on social media. However, veteran journalists tended to expel social media (Robinson 2010).", "In this study, journalists of different age groups\u2019 perceptions of social media culture in their newsrooms were studied, as well as the effects of social media culture on journalists\u2019 perception of and attitude toward social media. To delve into the intelligence of the difference between younger journalists and older journalists in accepting social media as an innovation\u2014adopting social media in daily journalistic work routines and engaging with audiences, and in light of previous literatures\u2014a hypothesized structural equation model (SEM) is proposed.", "SEM is a statistical methodology that takes a confirmatory approach to the analysis of a structural theory bearing on some phenomenon. Typically, this theory represents \u201ccausal\u201d processes that generate observations on multiple variables, where methods for testing theories are not well developed. And it is particularly appropriate for studying variables that are not directly observable because it provides an efficient and convenient way of describing the latent structure underlying a set of observed variables (Bentler 1988; Byrne 2000). SEM is a powerful analytical technique that combines multiple regression, path analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. The advantages of an SEM include: (1) assessing or correcting for measurement error(Byrne 2000; Raykov and Marcoulides 2006); (2) incorporating both observed variables and latent (factors) variables (Byrne 2000); (3) developing, estimating and testing direct and indirect effects of variables(Raykov and Marcoulides 2006); and (4) considering modeling of correlated errors, interrelations and interaction effects (Steenkamp and Baumgartner 2000). SEM is an advanced quantitative procedure that is adopted by more and more social science researchers.", "Based on the hypothesized SEM model (Figure 1), the following SEM model (Figure 2) was developed based on the survey design described in the Method section. In the new SEM model, social media use was divided into two latent factors: Twitter engagement and Facebook engagement. Latent factors\u2014perception of social media culture on journalism, journalists, and news organizations\u2014were combined into one latent factor, journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media.

Multiple-choice questions with five-point Likert scales were developed to ask the subjects about social media culture, social media engagement and their attitude toward social media in their news organizations. A clustered sampling strategy was utilized. First, the United States was divided into four regions: West, Mid-west, South and Northeast. Then eight states were randomly selected from each of the four regions.

However, the standardized path coefficient between Facebook engagement and attitude toward social media (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212.059, p\u2009>\u2009.05), was not statistically significant.

To test the mediation effects of Twitter engagement and Facebook engagement on journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media, mediation effects tests were conducted, and then standardized regression coefficient weights were compared between the direct effects with and without mediators and the indirect effects. The analyses showed the social media culture on journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media is mediated by Twitter engagement. The direct effect between social media culture on journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media without mediation is \u2212.205 (p\u2009<\u2009.001), the direct effect with the mediation of Twitter engagement is .019 (p\u2009>\u2009.05), the bootstrap indirect effect is \u2212.0222, p value is .019\u2009<\u2009.05. Therefore twitter engagement has a full mediation over social media culture on journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media; Between Facebook engagement and journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media, the direct effect between social media culture on journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media without mediation is \u2212.205 (p\u2009<\u2009.001), the direct effect with the mediation of Facebook engagement is \u2212.205 (p\u2009<\u2009.001), the bootstrap indirect effect is \u2212.014, p value is .521\u2009>\u2009.05. So there is no mediation effect of Facebook engagement between social media culture on journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media; H4a was supported. H4b was not supported.", "Age is the next moderator variable. The analyses showed a negative moderator effect for age. The Chi-square difference between the unconstrained model and the fully constrained model is 50.414 (df\u2009=\u200922, p\u2009<\u2009.001), which means there is significant difference between the two models. The unconstrained model is accepted. There is significant difference between the young (<30) journalists group and the old (>50) journalists group in terms of model fit.

This verified the findings from a recent survey of journalists in Finland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The result showed that media sector and size of the organization are important factors that affect journalists\u2019 use and views about social media (Gulyas 2013). The analyses of this study demonstrated that newsroom culture affects journalists\u2019 use and views about social media in American newsrooms. Moreover, the more the news organization accepts social media as an innovation, such as by providing effective instructions and trainings on how to use social media and calling on those who use social media effectively to coach others, the more journalists in the news organization will report engaging on social media. This may include tweeting or posting more about a story or event and rating highly the impact of social media on their news organization and journalism, such as the impact on journalists\u2019 credibility, their expertise in using social media, efficiency, and page views of their story.", "The analyses did not support the hypothesis that the more friendly a newsroom\u2019s culture is toward social media, the more positive journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media. This finding is in line with Wiik\u2019s (2010) conclusion that journalistic autonomy is increasingly challenged by working procedures and managerial attempts to exert control. The reason might be because of typical prevalent issues with social media, such as undermining journalists\u2019 autonomy, the profession, and the power of journalism (Waisbord 2013). In addition, the downside of its immediacy, faster accessibility and rapid news release might cause the failure of verification (Zeller and Hermida 2015). In fact, many journalists hold a negative attitude toward social media because they have been considered both challenges and threats to traditional journalism (Deuze and Bardoel 2001). Some scholars even are more pessimistic about the downside of social media, claiming that the detriments from social media are beginning to overwhelm the benefits (Silverman 2015). Moreover, despite the disruption of new technologies, the pursuit of truth and objectivity remains a cornerstone of journalistic integrity (Anderson and Schudson 2009). News organizations are struggling to respond to a host of new ethical challenges to avoid any impropriety that impugns the integrity of journalists and news organizations (Podger 2009). Scholars proposed a valuable balance\u2014recognizing social media\u2019s potential for negative developments such as disseminating rumors while appreciating the positive side of social media (Alexander 2014).", "The study also found Twitter engagement mediates journalists\u2019 social media culture and their attitude toward social media. The more journalists engage on Twitter, the more journalists believe Twitter engagement enhances their credibility as a journalist, and the bigger the impact they believe Twitter has on their news organization, the more positive their attitudes toward social media; in other words, the less likely they believe journalism created through social media has sacrificed the accuracy of a news organization, threatens their integrity, and the integrity of their news organization. This conclusion is in line with Gulyas\u2019 (2013) finding that the UK journalists were the most avid users of social media and held the most positive attitudes toward these tools. The results also echoed Lee\u2019s (2015) discovery about the influences of journalists\u2019 social media activities on journalists\u2019 perceptions of journalism.", "One of the interesting findings of this study is that the model distinguished Facebook from Twitter. Facebook engagement does not mediate social media culture and journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media. The reason why is maybe because Facebook and Twitter utilities are unalike, and journalists use Facebook and Twitter because of different motivations. Facebook and Twitter are different media, with varying degrees of appeal communication modes and networks. Facebook is more widely used than Twitter. For example, a recent study found Facebook is used more by politicians because of its large audience (Quinlan et al. 2018). Between Facebook and Twitter, Facebook is a social networking site that allows users to create a profile where they can post information about their profession, hobbies, favorite books, movies, or musicians to connect with \u2018friends\u2019. A Facebook user can build their friends\u2019 circle where to share pictures, web links, and videos. Facebook messenger is a convenient tool to message anyone in their friends\u2019 circles. All of these features, along with the creation of groups and fan pages make Facebook a popular personal communication tool (Hughes et al. 2012). Twitter\u2019s focus, however, is information and opinion sharing (Kwak et al. 2010), rather than social interaction (Huberman, Romero, and Wu 2009). In-depth interviews with news managers, social media producers and public relations officials in American broadcasting news organizations showed social media, in particular Twitter resources, are currently being used more promotional and audience tracking purposes than for news-gathering (Bloom, Cleary, and North 2016). Twitter users remain passive and consuming information, rather than sending their own content (Busemann 2013). Furthermore, the findings from this study showed that in terms of professional journalistic use, social media culture in newsrooms has a larger effect on younger journalists\u2019 than older journalists\u2019 Facebook engagement. However, social media culture in newsrooms has a smaller effect on younger journalists\u2019 than older journalists\u2019 Twitter engagement. The findings showed that Facebook is more popular among older journalists than younger journalists. Twitter is popular among journalists across different age groups. Which echoed the newly released demographic information of Facebook and Twitter users by Pew Research Center (Aaron and Monica 2018).", "When social media become important channels for large-scale of information diffusion online (Kwak et al. 2010; Bhattacharya and Ram 2012), it is valuable to understand how journalists of different ages use social media. The multiple group analyses found a significant model fit difference across middle-age journalists and older journalists, but not younger journalists and older journalists. This indicated that the digital age divide among journalists maybe in their 50s instead of 30s.", "As Bourdieu theorized, everything we say, do and show is evaluated by other actors in the field (Bourdieu 1993). Journalists\u2019 perception of social media culture is subject to the impact of other actors in newsrooms. This study found older journalists and middle-aged journalists tend to view their news organizations\u2019 social media culture had a greater effect on their Twitter engagement; and the more they engage on Twitter, the more middle-aged journalists tend to have a more positive attitude toward social media than other journalists. Younger journalists tend to view social media culture has a greater effect on their engagement on Facebook. Organizing of resources and collaborators in new patterns should be the route toward good quality of digital journalism (Landstr\u00f6m and Johannisson 2001). Younger journalists are trained to get prepared for digital newsrooms where social media are integrated into journalists\u2019 daily routines, particularly in well-recognized journalism schools. However, these students may enter into a larger news organization where the old print-centric culture seems to linger, where print culture is embedded in older journalists\u2019 attitudes about how to produce a good story, and where senior journalists take an \u2018expulsion\u2019 strategy toward social media (Carlson and Lewis 2015). Perhaps that conflict is the reason why the social media culture of a newsroom had the least influence on younger journalists among journalists of the three age groups.", "Journalists are expected to \u2018reskill, deskill, and upskill\u2019 their practices and working routines (Deuze and Witschge 2018), especially in the light of institutional, economic and technological change (Willnat, Weaver, and Choi 2013). The results showed that journalists of different ages have different expectations of social media engagement in the digital age. Covering news in real-time across multiple platforms with the assistance of social media is an expected scenario for younger journalists (Witschge 2012). In the present study, younger journalists favored Twitter, while older journalists embraced Facebook and middle-aged journalists adopted both Facebook and Twitter. The analyses showed the more that middle-aged journalists interacted on Twitter, the more they tended to have a positive attitude toward social media. However, the more that younger and older journalists engaged on Twitter, the more they tended to have a negative attitude toward social media. Journalists from all three age groups tended to hold a negative attitude toward social media if they engaged more on Facebook. The age divide findings were in line with results of previous studies. For example, Spyridou et al. (2013) also included age as an important factor to illustrate journalists\u2019 relation with audiences in a newsroom network and found younger journalists tended to believe in greater structural changes resulting in greater transparency and media control as well as dialogue opportunities. Likewise Gulyas (2013) found length of professional career was recognized as a significant factor that affects journalists\u2019 views about the impact of social media (Gulyas 2013).", "The findings indicated older journalists are picking up social media as a strategy of innovation, especially Twitter, and being nurtured a positive attitude toward them under the influence of their news organizations\u2019 social media culture. The finding is in line with previous research results: when seniors adopt digital technology, they make visiting the digital world a regular occurrence (Smith 2014). Moreover, the finding from this study signifies positively that social media are being communicated as an innovation, which aligns with Hermida and co-author\u2019s (2012) finding that the affordances and culture of social media are influencing how newsrooms are reporting the news. The fending off incursions or protection of autonomy (Lewis 2012) strategy adopted by most older journalists is being taken place by a positive attitude. However, there still maybe a long way for older journalists to become experts in social media."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Utilizing a SEM analysis, the study sought to understand how social media culture in newsrooms affects journalists\u2019 strategies of taking social media as an innovation, in particular social media engagement and their attitude toward social media, and how journalists of different age groups differ in the SEM model fit. The analyses indicated that H1, regarding social media culture and journalist\u2019 social media use, as well as H3a and H4a, concerning the mediating effect of Twitter, were supported. However, H2, regarding social media culture and Facebook use, as well as H3b and H4b, concerning the mediating effect of Facebook, were not supported. These results indicate Twitter engagement mediates social media culture and journalists\u2019 attitude toward social media while Facebook does not. Thus, as newsrooms continue to transition in the digital age, these results suggest they should create a culture that favors Twitter more than Facebook.", "Moreover, all three hypotheses concerning how age categories fit the SEM model (H5, H6 and H7) were not supported. The results suggest that the digital divide in social media use among journalists is not whether younger and older journalists use social media; rather the divide is between the types of social media they prefer to use. While younger journalists favored Twitter, older journalists embraced Facebook and middle-aged journalists adopted both Facebook and Twitter. The analyses showed the more that middle-aged journalists interacted on Twitter, the more likely they tend to have a positive attitude toward social media. However, the more that younger and older journalists engaged on Twitter, the more they tended to have a negative attitude toward social media. Journalists from all three age groups tended to hold a negative attitude toward social media if they engaged more on Facebook.", "The study is not without limitations. The response rate of the online survey was relatively low and the average age of the participants was 47.81 years old (SD\u2009=\u200913.50), which may not be representative enough for journalists in American newsrooms across the country and affect the generalizability of the findings.", "The SEM model developed from this study was shown to be a good fit and therefore may be applied to future research studies. For instance, future researchers may test the model with a comparatively younger journalists\u2019 age group to see whether younger and older journalists differ by age in the model fit. Furthermore, future researchers may explore whether differences exist among journalists\u2019 perception of social media culture on their attitude toward journalism, journalists and their news organizations."]}], "references": [{"title": "Depth of Processing, Belief Congruence, and Attitude-Behavior Correspondence", "year": "1999", "journal": "Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Ajzen Icek", "first_name": "Ajzen", "last_name": "Icek"}, {"name": "Sexton James", "first_name": "Sexton", "last_name": "James"}]}, {"title": "Social Media in Disaster Risk Reduction and Crisis Management", "year": "2014", "journal": "Science and Engineering Ethics", "volume": "20", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander David E.", "first_name": "Alexander", "last_name": "E."}]}, {"title": "On the Role of Emotion in the Future of Journalism", "year": "2016", "journal": "Social Media+ Society", "volume": "2", "authors": [{"name": "Beckett Charlie", "first_name": "Beckett", "last_name": "Charlie"}, {"name": "Deuze Mark", "first_name": "Deuze", "last_name": "Mark"}]}, {"title": "Journalists at a Crossroads: Are Traditional Norms and Practices Challenged by Twitter?", "year": "2018", "journal": "Journalism", "volume": "19", "authors": [{"name": "Bentivegna Sara", "first_name": "Bentivegna", "last_name": "Sara"}, {"name": "Marchetti Rita", "first_name": "Marchetti", "last_name": "Rita"}]}, {"title": "Traversing the \u2018Twittersphere\u2019", "year": "2016", "journal": "Journalism Practice", "volume": "10", "authors": [{"name": "Bloom Terry", "first_name": "Bloom", "last_name": "Terry"}, {"name": "Cleary Johanna", "first_name": "Cleary", "last_name": "Johanna"}, {"name": "North Michael", "first_name": "North", "last_name": "Michael"}]}, {"title": "The Processes of Adopting Multimedia and Interactivity in Three Online Newsrooms", "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of Communication", "volume": "54", "authors": [{"name": "Boczkowski Pablo J.", "first_name": "Boczkowski", "last_name": "J."}]}, {"title": "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis", "year": "1955", "journal": "Social Forces", "volume": "33", "authors": [{"name": "Breed Warren.", "first_name": "Breed", "last_name": "Warren."}]}, {"title": "Personal Branding on Twitter: How Employed and Freelance Journalists Stage Themselves on Social Media", "year": "2017", "journal": "Digital Journalism", "volume": "5", "authors": [{"name": "Brems Cara", "first_name": "Brems", "last_name": "Cara"}, {"name": "Temmerman Martina", "first_name": "Temmerman", "last_name": "Martina"}, {"name": "Graham Todd", "first_name": "Graham", "last_name": "Todd"}, {"name": "Broersma Marcel", "first_name": "Broersma", "last_name": "Marcel"}]}, {"title": "Social Media as Beat: Tweets as a News Source During the 2010 British and Dutch Elections", "year": "2012", "journal": "Journalism Practice", "volume": "6", "authors": [{"name": "Broersma Marcel", "first_name": "Broersma", "last_name": "Marcel"}, {"name": "Graham Todd", "first_name": "Graham", "last_name": "Todd"}]}, {"title": "Wer Nutzt was im Social Web", "year": "2013", "journal": "Media Perspektiven", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Busemann Katrin.", "first_name": "Busemann", "last_name": "Katrin."}]}, {"title": "Web Survey Methods: Introduction", "year": "2008", "journal": "Public Opinion Quarterly", "volume": "72", "authors": [{"name": "Couper Mick P.", "first_name": "Couper", "last_name": "P."}, {"name": "Miller Peter V.", "first_name": "Miller", "last_name": "V."}]}, {"title": "Beyond Journalism: Theorizing the Transformation of Journalism", "year": "2018", "journal": "Journalism", "volume": "19", "authors": [{"name": "Deuze Mark", "first_name": "Deuze", "last_name": "Mark"}, {"name": "Witschge Tamara", "first_name": "Witschge", "last_name": "Tamara"}]}, {"title": "What is so Special About Media Innovations?
