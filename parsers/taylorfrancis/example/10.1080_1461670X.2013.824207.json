The evidence from news articles, books, and social media demonstrated that although interactivity offered an opportunity for people to reclaim the story of the protests, the content in citizen-populated spaces only served to recreate the fiery binaries from the mainstream news coverage. Strategic rituals of objectivity dominated reportorial writing; citizens used eyewitness reports, personal experience, and links to assert their right to remember. In the end, the stories that emerged were so divisive\u2014even at the anniversary\u2014that no collective memory appeared to be coalescing and the state remained mired in its past. This case study serves as an opportunity to unveil the processes of collective memory formation in a digital era when citizens can help produce the nation's historical accountings alongside journalists. This evidence demonstrated that user-generated spaces online can disrupt formalized collective-memory formation and become a place where time stands still, raw feelings can fester, and little in the way of alternative perspective prevails, despite new-media scholars' hopes.", "body": [{"sec_title": "Introduction", "sec_content": ["On February 11, 2011, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and his Republican legislature introduced the \u201cbudget-repair\u201d bill that cut pensions for all public workers and throttled unions' rights to collectively bargain for benefits. Word spread by February 14 when the first wave of protesters\u2014about a thousand graduate students from the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2014demonstrated at the state Capitol. Crowds swelled to hundreds of thousands of teachers, public workers, and others. The \u201cWisconsin protests\u201d prompted a recall campaign against the governor and other politicians and spurred similar pro- and anti-union movements throughout the nation. A year later, citizens rallied again to commemorate the anniversary of the protests when journalists and citizens re-negotiated the meaning of the protests.", "This article seeks to tell the collective mnemonic story of the Wisconsin protests as it was forming during the anniversary in February and March 2012. Wisconsin's journalists and book authors worked to construct a formal, compelling, mythic narrative that imbued a sense of meaning into the unrest a year prior, even as continuing political uncertainty prevented any true historical account from solidifying. But as digital technologies have complicated the process of collective memory formation, this article also will investigate how citizens responded to these formal, published narratives in virtual spaces. Fisher (1987, 154), writing before the internet's popularization, considered audience as a mere presumption by an author\u2014an assumption shared by journalists and historians (Bodnar 1992; Edy 2006; Gillis 1994; Haskins 2007). However, with digital interactive capabilities, audiences as authors can exert their own mnemonic narrative role. Narrative characters, chronologies, settings, morals, and themes may no longer abide by any \u201cin common\u201d narrative rationality of the kind Fisher has described. This article documents the emerging collective memory(ies) of the Wisconsin protests in order to explore how online interactivity encourages new kinds of remembering and how those memories intersect with narratives developed by journalists and historians. This case study is particularly interesting because it offers an incredibly divisive event that polarized the state in 2011 and through 2012 at the anniversary.", "In essence, the collective memory developing at the time of the first anniversary in formal print publications and in more vernacular spaces like online citizen forums reaffirmed hegemonic values and situated the events in history. This evidence did not reveal a plethora of individual voices as scholars predicted, but rather demonstrated a polarization of two mainstream storylines emphasizing what it meant to be an ordinary Wisconsinite and American citizen. Whereas journalists fell back on strategic rituals of objectivity (Tuchman 1972), citizens attempted to gain authority and engage in \u201ccollective\u201d framing by sharing links, eyewitness reports, and personal experience. In their exuberance to demonstrate experience and knowledge\u2014and thus the \u201cright to remember\u201d\u2014citizens essentially reconstructed the original protests online, altered the temporal aspects of the protest memory, and reworked morals from the story. This problematizes the notion of an idealized collective memory because divergent citizen voices on a single event could stagnate the state in the past, rather than helping it to move forward."]}, {"sec_title": "Literature Review", "sec_content": ["Calling it the \u201cnarrative paradigm,\u201d Fisher (1987) proposed that humans conduct themselves according to a narrative logic. Historians, journalists, fiction writers, and others populate stories with a collection of symbols to explain by way of \u201cgood reason.\u201d Both the informal stories we participate in via interpersonal conversation and formal stories via public spaces help people contextualize their lives according to history, culture and character (Fisher 1987, xii). News scholars have adopted this paradigm to explain how reporters produce archetypes, perpetuate cultural values, repeat common myths, and generally assign narrative properties to the components of any news story (Barkin 1984; Bird and Dardenne 1997; Eason 1981; Gans 1979; Kitch 2005; Lule 2001; Zelizer 1990). Carey (1986) argued that such stories emerge not from individual news articles, but from the entire \u201ccurriculum\u201d of coverage, aggregating pieces of meaning into a master narrative of dominant values.", "Coined by sociologist Maurice Halbwachs, the concept of collective memory incorporates at its core the \u201cnarrative paradigm.\u201d Historians have often noted the communal contexts associated with interpreting social texts as legends. Lipsitz (1990) highlighted the link between history and popular culture, noting how emerging modes of storytelling such as the telegraph re-shape collective memory processes. Disagreement exists over who can serve as \u201cauthor\u201d of such collective narratives. Fisher (1984) believed the process of narrative construction represented a universal human trait, as all cultures in all eras have produced some form of story. Rowland (1987) criticized Fisher for ignoring expert domination in the public sphere and argued that collective narratives are not inherently democratic and do not necessarily serve as alternatives to hierarchical systems of social knowledge. The paradigm should act as a philosophical approach to interpreting and assessing human communication (Fisher 1989). As such, the narrative paradigm incorporates both formal narratives constructed by elites/professionals and the creative processes of citizens.", "Over time, professional and vernacular narratives coalesce into collective memory. Collective memory entails the collaborative, public creation of shared remembrance of national events (Zelizer 1995). This consensual understanding occurs via many cultural vehicles, including books, art, memorials, museums, and movies (Bodnar 1992; Hoerl 2007; Sturken 1997); collective memory is also presented and shaped by news narratives (Edy 1999; Kitch 2003, 2005; Robinson 2009; Schudson 1992; Sturken 1997; Zelizer 1992). Much has been written about how collective memory can become politicized as a way for present-day society to navigate contemporary uncertainty and unrest (Archibald 2002; Halbwachs 1992; Rosenzweig and Thelen 1998). It is through commemorative news reports following any crisis that a nation learns to cope and heal. In finding exemplar sources, reporters present characters within mythic narratives whose morals relay a positive message even in the face of senseless tragedy (Berkowitz 2010; Kitch 2003; Robinson 2009).", "The key here is the term \u201ccollective.\u201d Collective memory entails a dualistic creation of both the individual and universal understanding of past events (Zelizer 1994). Gillis (1994) wrote:Commemorative activity\u2009\u2026\u2009is by definition social and political, for it involves the coordination of individual and group memories, whose results may appear consensual when they are in fact the product of processes of intense contest, struggle, and in some instances, annihilation. (5) ", "Commemorative activity\u2009\u2026\u2009is by definition social and political, for it involves the coordination of individual and group memories, whose results may appear consensual when they are in fact the product of processes of intense contest, struggle, and in some instances, annihilation. (5)", "Any time a crisis occurs\u2014be it political unrest or a natural disaster\u2014journalists help to unify an often fractured public by offering an explanation of the situation, reassuring people of institutional authorities' competence, and reconnecting citizens with each other as well as with mainstream norms and values (Berkowitz 2010; Kitch 2003; Robinson 2009; Schudson 2002). Kitch (2003) calls this a collective ritual people must perform in order to reestablish a sense of communal wellbeing in the wake of disaster or tragedy. Journalists, for example, did not need to be told to assume a \u201cpastoral,\u201d \u201cprotective,\u201d and \u201cneighborly reassurance\u201d role post-September 11, wrote Schudson (2002, 41); journalists form and perpetuate the very notion of the \u201cconsensual we\u201d (41) during such times.", "But researchers have pointed out how anniversary stories often fail to revisit the complexities of the events. Whether in history books or news accounts, memory narrative has traditionally comprised literate, elite males to the exclusion of other voices unless that memory was confined to vernacular material such as quilts (Bodnar 1992; Gillis 1994; Haskins 2007). Consider Edy's (2006, 195) findings that: \u201cIndividuals are typically granted access to the news only briefly and therefore cannot engage in a concerted program to affect the development of stories about the past.\u201d Any individual counter-memory becomes an anomaly marginalized in the master narrative.", "With the advent of the internet and the rise of the \u201cmass self-communicator\u201d (Castells 2009), some scholars maintain the line has blurred between official, collective memory statement and vernacular particulars of remembrance\u2014that is, the individual, singular memory (Foot, Warnick, and Sneider 2005; Haskins 2007; Savoie 2010; Warnick 2002; Zelizer 2004). Much has been written about the way in which new media can alter the formation of a narratized collective memory (Neiger, Meyers, and Zandberg 2011; Haskins 2007; Robinson 2009; Savoie 2010; Zelizer 2004). Neiger, Meyers, and Zandberg (2011) argued that emerging digital technologies provide new venues for memory construction beyond traditional, elite media platforms, and Pinchesvski (2011) argued that online archives provide constraint-free platforms for memory construction, as well as opportunities for social ties to develop. While investigating the 9/11 archives for Ground Zero, Savoie (2010) argued that online venues created space for individual memory but that citizens also sought common storytelling. However, other forms of digital remembering privilege \u201cindividual particularity\u201d\u2014as Savoie (2010) calls it\u2014but little collective possibility. Thus, one wonders if the result may be little opportunity for a larger narrative to be healing, given other scholarship on the influence of collective memory.", "The widespread ability for people to bear witness in online archives and other enduring spaces should complicate, empower, and diversify memory narrative. One potential by-product of the melding of this former binary\u2014that is, particularity to universal\u2014is the ensuing narrative confusion that can occur (Huyssen 1995, 253). Volume, commercialization, and a growing superficiality in the sharing culture also add to the list of potential drawbacks of such mass mnemonic work in forums, blogs, archives, journaling, and other venues online (Gillis 1994; Haskins 2007; Manovich 2001). Studying the 9/11 digital archive, Haskins (2007) discovered that although the archive offered a diverse, democratic, and inclusive set of narratives, the archive narratives also resulted in political fragmentation and an acceleration of primary-event amnesia.", "If we accept the Web's potential for allowing alternative narratives, thereby democratizing narrative construction, then anniversary news coverage should reveal a cacophony of agendas, ideas, and memories about the original event, rather than a single, master narrative. Complicating the Wisconsin case was the participation of union members and solidarity symbols, such as the raised fist. The original protests in Madison depended upon a united front. The merging of the anniversary with the ongoing national Occupy Movement, which adopted the motto \u201cwe are the 99%,\u201d cemented that dependence on universality. Can the ability of the protester to mass self-communicate allow that person to undermine such a movement of solidarity? Our investigation was guided by the following questions for analysis:What are the narratives arising from the Wisconsin protests at its anniversary in press reports and books?How did individual citizens support or contest those narratives?What are readers to remember about the Wisconsin protests when considering all of this content as a \u201ccurriculum\u201d of coverage? What values are generated, hegemony reaffirmed, ideas purified, and dominant thought subverted (Fisher 1989)?

This amounted to 34 articles in 12 mainstream news publications from around the state. We included three books published around the anniversary that documented the original coverage authored by local historians or journalists\u2014authors intent on telling a cohesive narrative of what happened (Buhle and Buhle 2012; Nichols 2012a; Weidemann 2012). In addition, we collected the first 200 comments on each of the published news articles\u2014about 3500 comments in all. We supplemented this user-generated content (UGC) with social media content by collecting comments under news article postings in the two most frequented liberal Facebook Groups (\u201cShit my Governor is Doing to the State\u201d and \u201cShit My Governor Says\u201d) and the two most frequented conservative Facebook Groups (\u201cWe Support Scott Walker in Making Wisconsin Great Again\u201d and \u201cI Stand with Scott Walker\u201d).

Roots of complication: What motivations for taking part in the protest narrative can be discerned? Metaphors/catchphrases: What comparisons are being made, and what slogans evoked?

To capture this context, all material was read twice: once to interpret the content according to the matrix and once to discern the thematic patterns of the dominant and counter-narratives according to the genre of the authorship. In this re-reading, we applied concepts from narrative theory and collective memory scholarship. We examined how narrative elements formed a storyline generating a value system (Halbwachs 1992), offering subversive meaning (Fisher 1987) and counter-memory (Zelizer 1998), depicting archetypes (Lule 2001), and otherwise attempting to form a consensual \u201cwe\u201d (Schudson 2002) via the strategic rituals of classic journalism (Tuchman 1972)."]}, {"sec_title": "The Case Study", "sec_content": ["As with all historic events, the 2011 Wisconsin protest \u201cstory\u201d was multifaceted.

A year after Wisconsin farmers drove their tractors to the Capitol, one book author remembered them as patriotic: \u201cfor we electrical workers, gas station clerks, and accountants, farmers are a symbol of what America is, and what it can be. To lose what we were is to lose what we are\u201d (Weidemann 2012, 14). Those actions were also often described as first-time acts, and thus, more genuine and authentic (Spicuzza 2012). Protesters were described as \u201cstanding together\u201d (Nichols 2012b): \u201c\u2018It was about the solidarity with all the different struggles,\u2019 Pan [a student leader] said. \u2018Looking back, that's sort of what I got out of it. All of our struggles are interconnected\u2019\u201d (Peterson 2012). Their story reflected the story of every Wisconsinite, and also, therefore, of every American.

One commenter suggested the protesters were misguided, and unions were destroying the state via a grand conspiracy against rich job creators (Glauber 2012c).

Digital audiences do not operate with complete autonomy from mainstream sources; they still often follow mainstream cues. Nonetheless, digital tools give audiences new power to generate answers to questions formerly addressed predominantly by professional journalists. Were the 2011 protests a national ploy by unions? Were they grassroots uprisings by regular people and students? Were they spurred by a dictating trickster or a conservative, responsible hero? All of these storylines were renegotiated in online spaces, with significant contributions from both professional journalists and citizens, in an attempt to reclaim Wisconsin."]}, {"sec_title": "Discussion", "sec_content": ["Thinking about the anniversary coverage as a \u201ccurriculum\u201d (Carey 1989) and the idea that all communicative exchanges form some kind of a \u201cnarrative paradigm\u201d (Fisher 1989), we can follow two dominant narrative arcs through both the print and citizen coverage. Table 1 compares the dominant signature matrix that emerged from the content by journalists/authors with those in the commenting spaces. The major components of these developing collective memories overlap in both kinds of \u201ccoverage;\u201d however, individual citizen contributors expanded and countered major themes in the print coverage. Narratively, journalists and authors told formalized stories with heroic ordinary people overcoming adversity (bitter temperatures, power elites), combative-yet-responsible politicians, and symbolic allusions to the past and present that positioned the state and these protests within a more significant context. Citizens offered tales that demonized those responsible-capitalist politicians, marginalized those heroic protesters, and re-negotiated exactly what the protests were supposed to mean in Wisconsin history.", "Fisher (1989) suggested that any kind of communicative exchange would generate values, reaffirm hegemony, purify ideas, and/or subvert dominant thought. Digital memory scholars argued that self-archiving opportunities have the potential to alter the emerging dominant narrative of any given event. This next section explores several major themes that emanated from the data, to form a developing storyline of collective memory.", "The dominant theme in all this coverage presented a battle over the identity of the state of Wisconsin, especially in terms of how being a Wisconsinite translated into being an American. Referencing the labor union history of Wisconsin or \u201cFighting\u201d Bob Lafollette (an early twentieth-century Progressive who championed workers' rights) reminded people of the state's working-class roots. Making a point about people's tax bills or labeling the political candidate and rally organizer as a \u201cfirefighter\u201d did the same. To be a struggling working-class citizen is to be like many Americans; to protest is to exercise that identity.", "The narratives in the mainstream and UGC took up competing American values: the individual underdog triumphing over adversity and notions of a collective will that must democratically prevail. The anniversary represented an opportunity for mainstream journalists to contextualize the protests as a meaningful collective event to re-establish the individual's role in a democratic community, as in one article: \u201cThere is a renewed sense that all of us matter\u201d (Krueger 2012b). We saw similar storylines in the UGC where people also worked to establish their individual right to tell their story of the protests.", "Both print and citizen narratives sought to bear witness to protest retelling. For example, journalists reported on \u201cmemory documentation stations\u201d during the anniversary rallies (Krueger 2012a) that asked sources to share protest stories. Citizens recounted their role in protests via personal reports while referencing historical events and figures to contextualize the protests and seem authoritative. The hyperlinks peppered throughout these forums represented a symbolic mechanism for imparting legitimacy to the burgeoning collective memory. Bearing witness in these digital realms, alongside the mainstream press' first draft of history, entailed these new \u201cstrategic rituals\u201d during collective memory formation.", "When taken as a \u201ccurriculum\u201d of coverage, all the narrative themes reified traditional American values\u2014but those values were competing. The journalistic anniversary narratives revolved around the notion of democracy as the will of the people and the response when representative bodies, elites, or \u201cnon-ordinary\u201d people ignore or manipulate that will. For pro-protesters, the 2011 events embodied the spirit of democracy, despite the protests' intrinsic anti-institutional expression. Meanwhile, pro-governor commenters underscored the (also democratic) idea that Walker was duly elected and thus, his wisdom as the Responsible Capitalist should be heeded. These themes, nestled in the democracy-rules framework, illuminate a central tension around the issue of legitimacy: Whose will is legitimate? How do acts become legitimate? Who has power over this event's meaning? In virtual realms, citizens' re-negotiation of these ideas radicalized the balanced master narrative presented in mainstream stories, and in essence, reinstated the process of public contestation that Gillis (1994) lamented is lost when formal collective memories are put forward during anniversaries. However, the re-articulation of memory in the forums did not subvert any dominant thought in the way that Fisher (1987) argued might happen. Furthermore, individuals in the commenting spaces exercised new understandings about what it meant to \u201cbear witness,\u201d or at least how to convey one's witnessing in a ritualized manner.", "It is important to note we did not see the kind of plurality of stories or marginalized voices that other scholarship has suggested. Little subversion of dominant thought occurred. Rather, users adopted mainstream storylines in a way that showed their connections to a larger community. Commenters linked to \u201cevidence\u201d such as news articles or pictures from the event, trying to \u201cprove\u201d that they were not lone renegades. Many re-iterated slogans from a year prior like \u201cthis is what democracy looks like\u201d or \u201cUnion thugs! Union thugs!\u201d (Knutsen 2012b). This kind of protest re-living placed individual commenting into larger collectives, thus achieving the right to help form the collective memory of those past events.", "Thus, instead of \u201cmoving forward\u201d to the evolving governor-recall story as the major narrative resolution (i.e. the protests resulted in the recall movement and now the story would shift focus), citizens re-enacted the original story over and over in online forums, re-hashing the dominant characters' motivations and predicting alternative endings. If one of the major roles of collective memory is to unify the populace in the wake of unrest (Bodnar 1992; Edy 1999), then the result of this polarized contestation ironically arrested unification around a singular protest memory. Because UGC allowed for constant contestation of the major narratives in mainstream coverage, the ultimate narrative for the 2011 Wisconsin-protest collective memory could not coalesce."]}, {"sec_title": "Conclusion", "sec_content": ["This case proved a useful exploration of the process by which citizens participate in the remembering of a crisis or event. The evidence showed how in some cases, digital abilities to publish as formal, public, mass authors can contribute to further polarization as \u201cbearing witness\u201d becomes a political act for individuals (as well as journalists and historians). As we saw in Wisconsin, this has the potential to stagnate society and keep it mired in that past, preventing it from making sense of the past events in order to heal rifts and move forward. Collective memory scholars have argued that professional writers of the past have always politicized those past events for present-day circumstances; here we can see how citizens without professional authority to tell a formal, societal story used social media and other online spaces to re-invigorate the politics from that event, calling on current events to make their points. Instead of being \u201ccommunal,\u201d the dominant memories of citizens battled for value prominence without any cohesive master narrative, wounding anew and replaying the crisis over and over. On the other hand, as more authors help in the meaning-making of some divisive event, this loss of a singular master narrative allows for what might have been considered anomaly alternative voices to coalesce into a community of like remembering, which we also saw in this sample (particularly the Facebook Group pages). Furthermore, where other scholars have lamented the volume, commercialization and superficiality of citizen mnemonic content, this case study showed that citizen contributors also amplify journalistic themes and attempt to mimic reportorial technique. They appear to be striving for an emergent protocol that incorporates kinds of evidence and reasoning about the past event in a way that is not only meaningful to them but also contributes to an ever-evolving quilt of a memory. If that tale is not quite \u201ccollective,\u201d perhaps ultimately these voices will add to the \u201ccurriculum\u201d that is that past event's historical story, authored by many rather than a mere few.", "If collective memory is indeed never complete and remembrance is a constant process about reconciling the past with the present (Edy 2006; Zelizer 1995), then we must recognize that the protest anniversary represented only a single moment in time. At the anniversary of the 2011 protests, the political climate in Wisconsin remained charged and the memory of the protests was intractably caught up in ongoing unrest. This article was not meant to declare the finished collective memory for Wisconsin, but rather to document the remembrance as it was developing within the current political uncertainty in order to contribute to the growing body of work around the historical function of journalism evolving with digital technologies."]}], "references": [{"title": "The Journalist As Storyteller: An Inter-disciplinary Perspective", "year": "1984", "journal": "American Journalism", "volume": "1", "authors": [{"name": "Barkin Steve", "first_name": "Barkin", "last_name": "Steve", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Journalism and the Ironic Hero of Virginia Tech: Healing Trauma through Mythical Narrative and Collective Memory", "year": "2010", "journal": "Journalism", "volume": "11", "authors": [{"name": "Berkowitz Daniel", "first_name": "Berkowitz", "last_name": "Daniel", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Telling Stories and Making Sense", "year": "1981", "journal": "Journal of Popular Culture", "volume": "15", "authors": [{"name": "Eason David", "first_name": "Eason", "last_name": "David", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Journalistic Uses of Collective Memory", "year": "1999", "journal": "Journal of Communication Spring", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Edy Jill", "first_name": "Edy", "last_name": "Jill", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Clarifying the Narrative Paradigm", "year": "1989", "journal": "Communications Monographs", "volume": "56", "authors": [{"name": "Fisher Walter", "first_name": "Fisher", "last_name": "Walter", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Narration as a human communication paradigm: The case of public moral argument", "year": "1984", "journal": "Communication Monographs", "volume": "52", "authors": [{"name": "Fisher Walter", "first_name": "Fisher", "last_name": "Walter", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Web-based Memorializing after September 11: Toward a Conceptual Framework", "year": "2005", "journal": "Journal of Computer-mediated Communication", "volume": "11", "authors": [{"name": "Foot Kirsten", "first_name": "Foot", "last_name": "Kirsten", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Warnick Barbara", "first_name": "Warnick", "last_name": "Barbara", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Sneider Steven", "first_name": "Sneider", "last_name": "Steven", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Between Archive and Participation: Public Memory in a Digital Age", "year": "2007", "journal": "Rhetoric Society Quarterly", "volume": "37", "authors": [{"name": "Haskins Ekaterina", "first_name": "Haskins", "last_name": "Ekaterina", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Mario Van Peebles&#039; \u2018Panther\u2019 and Popular Memories of the Black Panther Party", "year": "2007", "journal": "Critical Studies in Mass Communication", "volume": "24", "authors": [{"name": "Hoerl Kristen", "first_name": "Hoerl", "last_name": "Kristen", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Mourning in America: Ritual, Redemption, and Recovery in News Narrative after September 11", "year": "2003", "journal": "Journalism Studies", "volume": "4", "authors": [{"name": "Kitch Carolyn", "first_name": "Kitch", "last_name": "Carolyn", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Mourning &#039;Men Joined in Peril and Purpose&#039;: Working-Class Heroism in News Repair of the Sago Miners&#039; Story", "year": "2007", "journal": "Critical Studies in Media Communication", "volume": "24", "authors": [{"name": "Kitch Carolyn", "first_name": "Kitch", "last_name": "Carolyn", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "\u2018If You Had Been with Us\u2019: Mainstream Press and Citizen Journalists Jockey for Authority over the Collective Memory of Hurricane Katrina", "year": "2009", "journal": "New Media \\& Society", "volume": "11", "authors": [{"name": "Robinson Sue", "first_name": "Robinson", "last_name": "Sue", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Narrative: Mode of Discourse or Paradigm?", "year": "1987", "journal": "Communications Monographs", "volume": "54", "authors": [{"name": "Rowland Robert C.", "first_name": "Rowland", "last_name": "C.", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "Memory Work in the Digital Age.
