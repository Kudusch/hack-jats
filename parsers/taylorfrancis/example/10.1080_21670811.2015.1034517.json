(Dutch female, aged 24)", "Recent years have seen increasing scholarly attention being devoted to exploring the changing nature of photojournalism across online news platforms, including the ways in which professional\u2013amateur interfaces are recasting the (largely unspoken) normative tenets shaping the craft (see also Allan 2013a, 2013b; Chesher 2012; M\u00f6ller 2012; Palmer 2012; Ritchin 2013; Sheller 2014; Wall and Zahed 2014). Such modes of enquiry have usefully complemented analyses of the challenges confronting journalism more widely, particularly with respect to the impact of digital technologies on news organisations in a climate of economic insecurity, where the continued viability of high-quality, original photo-reportage is recurrently called into question (see Becker 2013; Caple 2014; Kristensen and Mortensen 2013; M. Mortensen 2014; T. M. Mortensen 2014; Ritchin 2013; Yaschur 2012). This article aims to contribute to these pertinent debates by examining public perceptions of citizen smartphone imagery and its relationship to professional photojournalism. More specifically, we discuss the findings of an empirical study conducted with members of a particular demographic cohort often described as \u201cmillennial\u201d users\u2014that is, people born between 1980 and 1999\u2014who completed a qualitative questionnaire designed to elicit their views about professional and citizen photojournalism. Teens and young adults tend to be early adopters of technology and are often more experimental in their uses of it, making them valuable for articulating emerging norms and practices (Ito et al. 2010). On the basis of this evidence, several issues are identified and evaluated, including this type of imagery\u2019s perceived strengths and limitations, as well as its relative trustworthiness with respect to the truth-value of the images being generated."]}, {"sec_title": "This Study", "sec_content": ["Studies of mobile camera practices point to their increasing integration in everyday life and corresponding social affordances (Larsen and Sandbye 2014; Martin and Pape 2012; Pink and Hjorth 2012; Rantavuo 2008; Sarvas and Frohlich 2011; Villi 2010). Such imagery is typically of a personal nature\u2014capturing selfies and spontaneous shots of others on occasions such as nights out, celebrations, holidays, and the like\u2014in ordinary life contexts, often with the intent of sharing with peer groups. At the same time, however, the growing ubiquity of cheaper, easier-to-handle devices, as well as the ease with which ensuing imagery can be uploaded across social networking sites, has meant their use to document unexpected or extraordinary events has increased dramatically. The news value of citizen imagery produced when such events transpire has been recurrently hailed by news organisations and their audiences, particularly with regard to its immediacy, eyewitness authenticity and emotive affectivity in crisis situations (Allan 2013a, 2014; Bivens 2008; Chouliaraki 2010; Frosh and Pinchevski 2009; Pantti, Wahl-Jorgensen, and Cottle 2012). No longer the occasional exception to the general rule, breaking news reporting routinely relies on the willingness of ordinary people to bear witness to what they see and hear unfolding around them, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves.", "Social media editors working for news organisations are acutely aware that mobile photographs or video of potential newsworthy significance may well be interspersed amongst otherwise mundane imagery in personal collections gathered and shared via the likes of Twitter, Facebook, Path, Flickr, Instagram, Tumblr and YouTube, amongst others. A case in point occurred on 19 April 2013, when a 16-year-old woman from Watertown, Massachusetts tweeted two photos of her backyard showing SWAT teams taking up shooting positions during the post-Boston Marathon bombing manhunt. The images were widely shared on social media (a Twitter search at the time of writing reveals they were retweeted 12,809 times and \u201cfavourited\u201d 3057 times) and picked up and incorporated into breaking international news coverage. By that evening, the young woman, inundated with media requests, posted a tweet simply saying: \u201cFor everyone asking, if you would like to use my image you may. Please just give credit to me and my family. #watertown.\u201d1 Also noteworthy is the juxtaposition of these two images in relation to the types of imagery she customarily shared (see Figure 1), evidently her record of activities such as parties, cheerleading, sporting events and hanging out with friends, as well as her selection of viral Web-based content. Such instances point to the potentialities of smartphone imagery being re-appropriated from the lived contingencies of the ordinary (everyday life contexts) into projections of the extraordinary (personal perceptions of\u2014even possible engagement in\u2014citizen photojournalism).", "FIGURE 1  Two events tweeted by @shawna_england, Watertown, MA.

Here we recognise the impetus to elaborate upon previous theorising based on findings from pre-smartphone technologies (i.e. camera phones), namely due to evolving enhancements pertaining to the quality of the built-in camera, the availability of accompanying \u201cfilters\u201d, use of social apps which facilitate the sharing of imagery, and capabilities for constant, relatively affordable internet connectivity. In this respect, then, our study strived to de-familiarise the emergent forms, practices and epistemologies of smartphone usage, inviting participants to self-reflexively describe their own experiences with smartphone cameras and, furthermore, their perceptions of how others have used them in improvised, spur-of-the-moment documentation of potentially newsworthy events or situations. In this article, our attention is primarily on the latter end of this continuum. Our evidence was gathered via a qualitative questionnaire comprised of 10 open questions, formulated with the intention of ascertaining detailed opinions while, at the same time, teasing out otherwise tacit impressions, assumptions and expectations. For instance, one question asked: \u201cIf you were to witness a possible news event\u2014like an accident, fire, flood, violent crime, act of terrorism, etc.\u2014would you want to document what was happening? Please explain why or why not\u201d, while a later one simply queried: \u201cHow do you think pictures or videos produced by ordinary people compare to those made by professionals?\u201d As one might imagine, response length varied from short declarative sentences to longer paragraphs illustrated with detailed examples.", "In terms of the population, we limited ourselves to \u201cmillennials\u201d, that is, the demographic cohort of individuals born between 1980 and 1999. This priority reflected the rationale prevalent in pertinent research literatures that younger age cohorts tend to be early adopters of technologies, and typically exhibit strong emotional attachments to them, not least with respect to creative innovations (Livingstone and Helsper 2007; Poindexter 2012). \u201cWe hit our peak confidence and understanding of digital communications and technology when we are in our mid-teens; this drops gradually up to our late 50s and then falls rapidly from 60 and beyond\u201d, Ofcom\u2019s (2014) most recent Communications Market Report notes for the United Kingdom. \u201cAlmost nine in ten (88%) of 16\u201324s own a smartphone, compared to 14% among those aged 65+\u201d (see also Pew 2014).", "Scholarly and news industry debates often highlight the importance of this \u201creplacement\u201d cohort, particularly with respect to how its members actively adapt, integrate and repurpose the possibilities of digital, mobile technologies to personalise their experience of\u2014and interactivity with\u2014visual news provisions (Pavlik 2013; Westlund 2013; see also Peters and Witschge 2015). In order to begin rendering problematic this concern, as well as the cultural specificities of smartphone camera usage\u2014recognising that no comparative inferences could be drawn from our limited data-set\u2014we adopted a non-representative, purposeful-sampling technique that combined aspects of snowball and convenience sampling (Marshall 1996), designed to generate meaningful insights from this selected group. Responses were collected from approximately 90 \u201cmillennials\u201d in Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, as detailed in Table 1.", "Qualitative responses were analysed systematically, evaluating each questionnaire and categorising comments on the basis of participants\u2019 personal experiences, descriptive explanations of their perceptions regarding others and orientation towards normative convictions (see Charmaz 2014; Kohlbacher 2006). The first generative phase resulted in empirical sorting of documents for each countries\u2019 respondents, helping to identify recurrent themes and relative emphases in the statements proffered. Subsequent phases refined the textual analysis of these responses, gradually juxtaposing the questionnaire\u2019s wording and structure with five related thematics that were identified, namely: (1) respondents\u2019 views regarding the prospective role of bearing witness and what it may entail for those prepared to adopt it; (2) the motivations of those engaged in this type of activity; (3) the uses of citizen smartphone imagery by news organisations; (4) presumed distinctions between professional and amateur or citizen photojournalism; and (5) ethical questions of trust where the ensuing imagery is concerned, amongst other, less clearly demarcated issues. The purpose of this iterative process-based approach was to embrace the principle of staying close to qualitative data by using our respondents\u2019 own answers as the rationale for setting out the terms of our empirical discussion; in other words, participants\u2019 responses when relied upon to set down its narrative logic, with due attention to relative prominence and emphasis. A further heuristic advantage of this mode of enquiry, we would suggest, is its scope to capture perspectives that may have seemed contrary, even counter-intuitive, vis-\u00e0-vis the interpretive frameworks informing the study\u2019s design and implementation. Beginning in the next section, then, we briefly touch on respondents\u2019 accounts of their ordinary experiences of smartphone usage before turning to consider their personal aptitude to bear witness to possible news events."]}, {"sec_title": "Bearing Witness\u2014Or Not", "sec_content": ["Respondents recurrently emphasised the extent to which having their smartphone with them was a near-constant feature of their everyday experience. \u201cI always have my phone with me, and therefore always have a camera at the ready\u201d, was one typical disclosure. \u201cThis means I never miss a photo opportunity\u201d (CAN, M, 16a).2 Suggestive here is the importance of carrying the smartphone as a matter of routine, where portability was a key factor. \u201cBecause phones go almost everywhere with people, they always have that option of using the camera\u201d (CAN, F, 17a), was a related response, as was: \u201cyou always have a camera with you, so even when you\u2019re not prepared to take photos you can capture nice/special moments\u201d (NL, F, 25a). Similarly pertinent is the opportunistic sense of engagement that emerges, with little indication that pre-planning governs this type of photographic practice. Instead, much is made of the ways in which \u201cyou can capture something that happens spontaneously and you can whip out your phone and record/capture it\u201d (CAN, M, 17a). Mobile photography in\u2014and of\u2014the moment is prized, repeatedly signalled throughout the questionnaire data by phrases along the lines of \u201ccatching moments instantly\u201d, \u201chaving a camera at your disposal to capture unplanned/unexpected moments\u201d or \u201cthe freedom to take pictures at any moment\u201d.", "A close reading of these and related responses regarding the lived negotiation of smartphone camera usage helped to discern the contours of an evaluative basis to consider insights garnered from our data concerning more extraordinary conditions. Here we posed a hypothetical scenario in order to identify certain documentary, even possibly reportorial, implications worthy of closer scrutiny. Specifically, we asked: \u201cIf you were to witness a possible news event\u2014like an accident, fire, flood, violent crime, act of terrorism, etc.\u2014would you want to document what was happening? Please explain why or why not.\u201d Although no attempt was made to secure quantitative percentages in relation to our qualitative interpretive framework, a careful, methodical appraisal of the answers helped to illuminate certain points of contrast.3 For several of those able to envision themselves performing some form of documentary role, the novelty of the experience was significant. \u201cYes, because it is something you don\u2019t see every day and it may help to fix the situation\u201d (CAN, F, 17b), said one, while another affirmed: \u201cYes. These things don\u2019t happen a lot in your life. You want to save them as a life experience\u201d (UK, F, no age given). At the same time, however, personal safety was frequently cited as a key consideration, either for others\u2014\u201cIf someone is in danger I would be more proactive rather than taking a photo\u201d (CAN, F, 21)\u2014or for themselves. \u201cI would if it weren\u2019t to put myself or anyone else in danger\u201d, one UK respondent affirmed, \u201cas it could help the emergency services in any search or investigation as a result of the event\u201d (UK, M, 20a). Others recognised that they would react differently were the circumstances dangerous. \u201cIf it is a panic situation I\u2019d probably focus on ensuring my safety\u201d (CAN, F, 20), one acknowledged, while another conjectured: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t come close to an act of terrorism or a violent crime cause that\u2019s pretty scary and dangerous, though I would capture the moment of a fire or flood cause it\u2019s pretty cool in my opinion\u201d (NL, M, 16a).", "Descriptions of the nature of the documentary role, together with the reasons expressed for adopting it, recurrently brought to the fore the evidentiary status of the mobile photograph in crisis situations. Illustrative examples include those raising the issue explicitly, such as: \u201cYes, of course! Coz it\u2019s evidence\u201d (UK, M, 20b) or \u201cA picture is evidence of some event that has taken place. To me the quality of the picture does not matter a lot but what has happened does matter\u201d (NL, M, 26a). Aesthetic considerations mattered much less than the mobile image\u2019s status as \u201cvisible evidence\u201d for several respondents. \u201cI think it is important that people can see what has happened. Also, it can be used as evidence when the events are later reconstructed\u201d (NL, M, 29). The use-value of such imagery was frequently marked as temporally bound, either in terms of immediacy and sharing being highly valued, signalled in responses such as: \u201cI\u2019d like to document it to show my friends that weren\u2019t present\u201d (UK, F, 24a) or \u201cYou can rewatch it, show friends and family, share to internet\u201d (CAN, F, 18) or, alternatively, more for purposes of securing a historical record that could prove beneficial in future. \u201cI would want to document it because even if I show the footage to nobody\u201d, one Canadian respondent stated, \u201cthere will be hard evidence available in existence to call upon\u201d (CAN, M, 18a). Notions of visible evidence repeatedly resonated in more forensically oriented registers as well. Several respondents reaffirmed the importance of an accurate visual record for purposes of assisting police efforts to determine what had transpired: \u201cI would take a picture or video to upload to YouTube. Get raw footage. It could help the police with leads on what happened\u201d (CAN, M, 16a) or \u201cIf I were witness. I think I want to document. Because it can help police to find the reason\u201d (UK, F, 22). One UK respondent cited \u201csocial conscience\u201d as \u201cplaying the most important factor\u201d for why, in his view, \u201cmost people\u201d would be \u201ckeeping a record to help police catch the culprit/s\u201d (UK, M, 20c).", "These and related responses, in our reading, signalled a personal conviction in the truth-value of the photographic record as \u201cproof to help solve the situation\u201d (CAN, M, 18b), which opens up intriguing questions about why some respondents resisted the idea of adopting such a documentary role. Numerous reasons were cited by those responding in the negative, who stated a preference to not document what was happening, especially in violent circumstances. Several conceded they would be frightened\u2014\u201cI\u2019d be too scared\u201d (UK, F, 19a) to act\u2014while others insisted their priority would be to lend assistance to those caught up in the crisis:I\u2019ll probably [be] thinking of other things rather than \u201clet\u2019s take a picture!\u201d (UK, M, 22a)I witnessed a weird car accident last week, but was to[o] flabbergasted to think about taking a picture.

When raised, \u201cnewsworthy\u201d encompassed relaying imagery to friends and family as well as deciding to \u201csend it in to the news\u201d when warranted. In the case of the former, the affectivity of first-hand experience\u2014where events may be \u201cso tragic and sad\u201d\u2014was typically emphasised. \u201cIf I was away from my family, girlfriend, and/or close friends\u201d, one Canadian responded remarked, \u201cthen I would want to share this information with them through pictures to show them exactly how close, how severe, and the emotion that is happening at that moment\u201d (CAN, M, 15). For the latter, a telling response was offered by a Dutch respondent who commented, \u201cI would, of course, not film corpses or murders, but fires and accidents, I would. If I could help somebody, I would do that first, but I think I cannot resist being the \u2018source of the news\u2019\u201d (NL, M, 19). For those alert to mobile imagery\u2019s journalistic possibilities, social media were obvious options, particularly Twitter and YouTube and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. \u201cTwitter is a great way to break news\u201d, said one. \u201cYou can help [the] information chain by sharing what\u2019s going on\u201d (UK, M, 22b). Others expected they would look more directly to news organisations. \u201cIf it was appropriate then yes, it\u2019s a good idea to take photos/videos of those events to provide to news stations so they get a close-up of the action\u201d (CAN, M, 16b). While one Dutch respondent expressed a desire to help with \u201cnews flow\u201d, she also observed: \u201cit feels bad taking pictures while you could have helped someone instead. It feels a bit like taking advantage of another person\u2019s misery\u201d (NL, F, 24a).", "Perhaps not surprisingly, a small number of respondents, while aware of journalistic interest in this type of imagery, consciously opted out of performing this role nonetheless. \u201cIt is not my job to document anything\u201d (UK, F, 19b), one UK respondent maintained. \u201cThe pictures I make are my private stuff\u201d, a Dutch respondent insisted. \u201cI\u2019m not like a Bild-Leserreporter [German tabloid], I\u2019ve got more things to do with my life\u201d, before adding: \u201cI probably would, if I would do anything, try to call the police\u201d once they had returned home (NL, F, 28)."]}, {"sec_title": "Possible Motivations", "sec_content": ["In endeavouring to delve deeper into the factors shaping what, if anything, would compel respondents to send their images to a news organisation, our questionnaire also asked them to comment on the possible motivations of other people willing to contribute images, and what they thought about journalists and editors using this type of material. As one would expect, a wide range of views were expressed, many of which were qualified in relation to specific circumstances (again, a sense of appropriateness and context-dependency proving important) rather than being expressed as firm principles per se. Here it may be equally telling to observe how rare it was for respondents to mention the prospect of sending mobile imagery into a news organisation, at least until prompted to reflect on this possibility by our questionnaire. As noted, this may be due to a decision to reserve such responses for subsequent questions (having read through the questionnaire before answering, perhaps), but it nonetheless suggests a basis to render problematic any easy presumption that respondents automatically thought of their photos and the potential value of this imagery to news organisations in this regard in the first instance.", "While a small number of respondents expressed bewilderment about why others might be inclined to relay mobile imagery to news organisations, the vast majority were willing to speculate, making it possible to discern recurrent tropes for closer inspection. Most attributed positive motives to others, with a desire to share being a key consideration: \u201cI think people send their images into news organizations because they want to share what they see with others\u201d (CAN, F, 16a) makes the point succinctly, as does: \u201cthey want to show that they have something to share. They may be proud if their photograph is starred in a newspaper\u201d (NL, F, 17). Sharing was on occasion implicitly linked to sociability (\u201cI think this is so people can say that they helped out by supplying the image\u201d; CAN, F, 17b), in our reading, as well as a sense of social obligation: \u201cMaybe they think it\u2019s a part of their duty?\u201d (UK, F, no age given), \u201cthey feel a responsibility to share the information\u201d (CAN, M, 18e) or \u201cthey want to do something for the public\u201d (NL, F, 28). Even heroism figured in some responses. \u201cI think a part of it for some people is to fulfil the sense of heroism. They feel like they have done a solemn [duty] for the community\u201d (CAN, F, 17c). An implicit appeal to civic engagement\u2014and here it is intriguing to note the near-absence of explicit references to \u201ccitizen journalism\u201d in the responses to this set of questions\u2014was further evident in affirmative emphases placed on using images to focus public attention, particularly in crisis situations. \u201cSending images into news organizations is a good way of alerting the public of an event, good or bad\u201d (CAN, M, 18c).", "For those respondents disinclined to project altruistic motivations\u2014\u201ccivic duty\u201d (NL, M, 24a) or \u201cthey want to contribute to society\u201d (CAN, M, 16a)\u2014on to those involved, a number of possible motives were rehearsed. Some individuals were perceived to be producing mobile images in the hope of acknowledgement for being on the scene. \u201cThey do it to get on the news\u201d (CAN, M, 16a), one respondent asserted, while another surmised: \u201cSome probably do it for the recognition, and others do it to share important events with others\u201d (CAN, M, 18d). This subtle distinction between self-aware interests and the virtues of sharing with others was frequently drawn in sharper terms. \u201cPeople want their voices heard\u201d, a Dutch respondent maintained. \u201cSome will do it for the right reasons (helping others), others because they want to get \u2018likes\u2019 and \u2018views\u2019\u201d (NL, F, 29). Here some offered comments tinged with a certain cynicism, in our reading, with respect to a quest for celebrity. \u201cEverybody wants their 15 minutes of fame I guess\u201d (NL, F, 24b), remarked one, while others echoed: \u201cA little taste of fame\u201d (CAN, F, 20) and \u201cI think they do it because it is their shot at quick fame, simply put\u201d (CAN, M, 18a). Several related perceptions referred to how \u201cPeople probably do it to get popular\u201d (UK, M, 27) or because such images \u201ccould be valuable or special and it would make them feel important\u201d (NL, M, 26c). Comparable forms of scepticism expressed about potential motivations concerned financial gain. \u201cOne understands that having the best image/video will get top dollar from news organizations, hence this is a prime motivator\u201d (UK, M, 20c). Still another conjectured: \u201cSome do it as an act of journalism, others might do it for money\u201d (UK, M, 29), which evidently held in tension a sense of public service versus private gain, at least in our interpretation. \u201cMaybe they hope to get some money for it\u201d, one Dutch respondent mused, while another wondered: \u201cMaybe they get paid or are aspiring journalists\u201d (UK, F, 19a).", "While this sense of mobile photography as an \u201cact of journalism\u201d was seldom elaborated in detail, references to the importance of ordinary citizens being on the scene because \u201csometimes journalists can\u2019t be on the spot in time\u201d (NL, F, 25b) featured far more prominently. \u201cI think using images from ordinary people is important\u201d, another added, \u201cbecause it is not possible to have camera crews everywhere\u201d (CAN, M, 18d). This conception of the citizen pressed into service in the absence of a journalist to bear witness\u2014sometimes described as \u201ccitizen witnessing\u201d (Allan 2013a)\u2014would appear to inform several of the respondents\u2019 assessments. \u201cI think it\u2019s positive as it encourages people to tell a story first hand\u201d, one of the UK respondents stated. \u201cI think they do it as they share this view\u201d (UK, M, 22b). In drawing distinctions with the professional\u2019s point of view, the ordinary individual\u2019s eyewitness imagery was recurrently reaffirmed as intrinsically valuable in its own right. \u201cThis allows the world to see the perspective from a real life citizen, in their home or city, rather than just a general over view of what a specific center sees\u201d (CAN, M, 15), one respondent believed. Further reportorial virtues to be associated with citizen witnessing included: \u201cHelps build a full picture\u201d (UK, M, 24), \u201cThis way you can get images really fast and from really close to the event happening\u2019\u201d (NL, M, 26a) or \u201cIt gives a realistic impression on what happened. It keeps the truth visible\u201d (CAN, M, 16a).", "To the extent citizen mobile imagery makes available, in the words of one respondent, \u201ca different view than professional pictures\u201d (CAN, F, 16b), it is a view usually defined as supplementing, rather than supplanting, those otherwise proffered by journalists. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with using images recorded by ordinary people\u201d, one respondent believed, \u201cas it gives us readers a unique view from the \u2018public eye\u2019\u201d (CAN, M, 18c). Indeed, the capacity of the \u201cpublic eye\u201d to render \u201cthe truth visible\u201d was lauded for extending journalism\u2019s reach by securing imagery that would not have been garnered otherwise. In addition to bringing \u201clesser known stories\u201d to light, mobile images taken by ordinary people were seen to open up alternative news angles. Indeed, here it is worth noting how often comments lauding this imagery for showing a multiplicity of \u201cdifferent sides\u201d to a news event served to underscore\u2014explicitly or implicitly\u2014certain limitations with professional reportage, especially the pragmatic drawback of journalism\u2019s ability to capture \u201cbreaking\u201d news as it occurs.", "The perceived truth-value of citizens\u2019 mobile imagery\u2014its de facto authenticity effectively underwritten by its very amateurishness\u2014accentuated the perceived merits of this alternative ethos. In other words, concomitant with the citizen\u2019s ability to \u201ckeep fresh eyes\u201d (UK, F, 24b) on a breaking news event was the implied conviction that such imagery was equally and, in some instances, more compelling in journalistic terms than that provided by their professional counterparts. \u201cI think it is much more interesting when the film comes from ordinary people because it makes you believe it\u2019s much more real\u201d (CAN, F, 17c), one respondent stated, while another noted: \u201cit\u2019s good when journalists use footage and images from ordinary people as it makes them feel more connected. Also a witness could get better photos than a reporter\u201d (CAN, F, 17d). Citizens were to be credited, several respondents maintained, for helping to gather the \u201cproof\u201d good journalism required. \u201cPeople (viewers) need to actually see the reality of a news event\u201d (CAN, F, 21), one responded contended, thereby illuminating a tension\u2014in our reading\u2014between formal reportorial mediation and the implied truthfulness of first-hand experience captured in amateur mobile photography. At the same time, others pointed out that the ensuing imagery needed to be handled carefully to ensure it was \u201clegit\u201d, that is, credible as \u201cdocumentary evidence\u201d, as one UK respondent noted, given that it \u201ccan be [an] unreliable source for journalists as people can edit\u201d (UK, F, 23). Journalists need to \u201cstay driven by the facts\u201d and not opinions, a Dutch respondent warned, because \u201ca video/picture is always an opinion of someone\u201d, and as such \u201cit can be altered or (essential) stuff can be let out of the scope of the picture/video\u201d (NL, M, 24b).", "While the majority of respondents to our questionnaire evidently considered public involvement in news-making to be beneficial, a small minority of detractors voiced their concerns. \u201cJournalists using images recorded by ordinary people are lazy and unprofessional\u201d (UK, F, 24a) was the rather provocative assertion made by one respondent, while another insisted that citizen imagery represented \u201csmart thinking, especially when the journalist is lazy\u201d (NL, M, 27). Such views were very much the exception. Even sceptical voices tended to offer qualifiers, believing the journalistic use of such images was acceptable \u201cprovided they are relevant and contribute to the story\u201d (CAN, F, 22). Further comments in this regard included: \u201cIf it\u2019s really cool\u201d (NL, F, 25b) or \u201cIf what I was seeing was amazing/shocking me and I felt the need for it to be seen by the masses\u201d (UK, M, 21)."]}, {"sec_title": "The Limits of Professionalism", "sec_content": ["While elucidating possible motivational factors concerning the contribution of visual imagery to news organisations was a key rationale grounding our questionnaire, further effort was made to tease out the normative expectations and evaluations of such contributions. This prompted us to explore our respondents\u2019 perceptions regarding how mobile photographs or videos compare to those produced by professional photojournalists. Prime qualities attributed to imagery captured by ordinary members of the public tended to revolve around its relative verisimilitude\u2014typically articulated via terms such as authenticity, truth and credibility\u2014at times in tension with, even contradistinction to, professional image-making.", "Observations made about visual image quality almost always credited professionals with superior skills and camera gear, which was hardly surprising. \u201cProfessionals tend to be better equipped and more experienced, producing better quality or less \u2018shaken\u2019 or \u2018blurred\u2019 captures\u201d (UK, M, 22c), one respondent noted, while another stated: \u201cordinary people just use common tool (ex. Smartphone camera) to capture the events, while professionals use sophisticated tools to capture events\u201d (UK, F, 24c). Professionals were similarly praised for being more \u201cserious\u201d and \u201crefined\u201d, paying attention to \u201cthe composition of a picture\u201d, and expertise in handling \u201csharpness\u201d, \u201clight\u201d and \u201cangles\u201d effectively to record \u201ccomplete\u201d, \u201cneutral\u201d images. Talent and technical proficiency were certainly valued, although not to be conflated with image integrity, as several comments pinpointed. \u201cObviously the quality isn\u2019t as good from ordinary people\u201d, one respondent maintained, \u201cbut the content could be more raw or informative and less scripted because news usually shows up after the event, people are already at the scene as it happens\u201d (CAN, F, 22). Another respondent made a related point, stressing that citizen imagery may not be as \u201chigh quality\u201d in comparison, but its \u201cinformation content can be just as if not more valuable\u201d (CAN, M, 18e). In this way, \u201cinformation content\u201d superseded compositional virtues in the eyes of most, particularly where imagery\u2019s affective qualities proved significant. \u201cIn terms of aesthetic, the professional photos are much prettier, and often a piece of art\u201d, one Dutch respondent remarked. \u201cThe video taken by \u2018ordinary people\u2019 are usually wobbly and have bad sound quality, but can also capture the real emotions of the people present during the event\u201d (NL, F, 29). Another commenting on this apparent tension similarly signalled a realignment of priorities: \u201cProfessionals studied to take neutral, transparent pictures while ordinary people want to express their emotions\u201d (NL, F, 18).", "Photojournalism\u2019s professional commitment to dispassionate relay was thus found wanting, in the view of some respondents, precisely because the ensuing imagery was less likely to secure the same emotive purchase as that generated by amateurs. A recurring theme suggested that the very unpolished \u201crawness\u201d of \u201cnovice\u201d imagery represented a positive attribute, not least due to its presumed truth-value. \u201cThe ones produced by ordinary people make viewers feel more connected to what is going on\u201d, a Canadian respondent believed. \u201cIt makes it feel real rather than a story being produced\u201d (CAN, F, 16c), while a Dutch one noted that although amateur images \u201cmay be technically less high standard, they do offer the most authentic report of the event\u201d (NL, M, 29). A UK respondent evidently concurred, similarly stressing that such images: \u201cCan be more \u2018real\u2019\u2014i.e. no effects and so more true-to-life than professional; but perhaps not as detailed as professionals\u201d, before adding: \u201cProfessionals have an agenda and so film in a specific way, whereas public just record what\u2019s happening\u201d (UK, F, 23). To the extent professional practice observed certain conventions or protocols, it followed, the resultant images risked being perceived as less \u201crealistic\u201d, and as such more prone to be \u201cbiased\u201d, \u201cscripted\u201d or \u201ctwisted\u201d. On this basis, it seemed, \u201cordinary pictures make it feel more personal\u201d (CAN, M, 17b), as one respondent stated, while another explained they \u201callow people to see the event from the perspective of someone like them\u201d (CAN, F, 17b).", "This was not to deny the need for normative limits to be imposed on \u201camateur material\u201d in keeping with \u201cgood taste\u201d, however, as several respondents made clear. Concern was expressed by some that certain images were \u201ctoo shocking\u201d or \u201cpainful\u201d to be made public, thereby raising \u201cmoral problems\u201d for news organisations. \u201cI think these journalists and editors should be selective when it comes to this material, and they should restrain from using everything just because they want to show it all\u201d, one Dutch respondent maintained. \u201cIt should not become a sensational bloody horror show, that is painful to those involved. But those very gruesome images can still contribute to reconstructing the event afterwards\u201d (NL, M, 29). Nevertheless, even though the very \u201crawness\u201d of citizen images capturing \u201creal emotions\u201d occasionally necessitated editorial filtering to stay within the bounds of appropriateness, it was recurrently cited as a virtue nonetheless, as noted above. \u201cThey seem more real \u2026 more reliable and authentic not polished in a studio somewhere\u201d (UK, F, 19a), one respondent elaborated, while another warned: \u201cProfessionals might stage a video or photo more than an amateur because they have a certain message they want to bring across\u201d (NL, F, 24b). Discernible here, then, are certain binary tensions\u2014such as real/reliable/authentic versus polished/staged resonating in these last two quotations\u2014which, we would suggest, illuminate further contours of otherwise tacit amateur\u2013professional dichotomies.", "Nowhere were these tensions more pronounced than in respondents\u2019 comments concerning the processing of news imagery. \u201cNowadays, everybody can be a professional photographer. All you need is a phone with a good camera and Photoshop\u201d (UK, F, 25a), a respondent declared. Varied references to the use of editing software, particularly Photoshop, surfaced repeatedly. In most instances, however, it was ascribed to a skill-set associated with the realm of the professional news photographer. \u201cWhen the pictures/videos are made by ordinary people they seem to be more authentic\u201d, a respondent maintained, \u201cbecause ordinary people don\u2019t have the kind of software and editing techniques that professionals have\u201d (CAN, F, 17c). Professionals, in the view of another, are \u201chighly skilled in the use of editing software and are more able to leave out or add thing to the picture unseen\u201d, which suggested to him that the \u201camateur\u2019s pictures would count in this way as more trustworthy\u201d (NL, M, 26b). \u201cI would trust an ordinary persons picture more because a professional\u2019s can be photoshopped easier and twist the image\u2019s integrity\u201d (CAN, F, 17b), one respondent contended, while another said he \u201cwould trust the ordinary people\u2019s photos/videos more because they mostly don\u2019t know how to use Photoshop and they want to share the picture to their friends\u201d. \u201cProfessionals\u201d, he continued, may take \u201cawesome photos\u201d but are \u201cmaking money off of them and use some editing programs\u201d (CAN, M, 17a). Time and again, the editing of images was perceived to be potentially problematic, being characterised by some as \u201cmanipulation\u201d, \u201cdoctoring\u201d, \u201ctampering\u201d, \u201cairbrushed\u201d or worse: \u201cthe average person does not have as many corrupting influences, the use of Photoshop, etc.\u201d (UK, M, 20c), a respondent insisted. Another maintained: \u201conly professionals know how to forge/fake a picture and make people believe it\u2019s true\u201d (UK, F, 19b).", "For those respondents more inclined to place their trust in professional photographers, this contention\u2014namely ordinary people typically lack the technical competence to falsify photographs convincingly\u2014was suggestive of a recurring counter-position to a relationship of equivalence otherwise presumed between citizen imagery and visual verisimilitude. In these cases, numerous respondents pointed to ethics as a factor complicating this presumption, voicing concern over the relative motivation and degree of accountability attributable to such practices. For them citizen imagery was open to compromise. \u201cI should trust info from professionals more, maybe because ordinary people can abuse their photos to make them more exciting\u201d, one Dutch respondent stated. \u201cLike using Photoshop or something like that\u201d (NL, F, 23b). In contrast with their apparent confidence in the professional\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to make sure they are the truth\u201d (UK, F, 24b), then, some expressed misgivings about ordinary people\u2019s intentions and whether what they purported a photo\u2019s content to be was necessarily honest. \u201cNever sure if it\u2019s a hoax or not\u201d (UK, M, 22a), one respondent complained, registering their scepticism about citizen imagery. \u201cSomeone may have an agenda/motive behind filming\u201d (UK, F, 23) another noted, while one went further, contending: \u201cI guess the amateur has the advantage of it coming across as authentic and maybe even more dramatic. However, an amateur can easily lie/produce a fake story whereas a professional has an image they need to protect\u201d (NL, F, 24b). Credibility defined on these terms, that is, by the professional\u2019s investment in limiting, if not avoiding reputational risk, proved a telling point of comparison with the non-professional. \u201cI think I would rather believe a picture of a professional at the simple reason that they can not afford it to publish fake pictures\u201d, declared one. \u201cIt\u2019s their job, so they have to be reliable\u201d (NL, M, 16b). Here the probable repercussions in the event that transgressions were exposed similarly figured. One respondent, in explaining why he \u201cpersonally would be less eager to trust an ordinary person\u2019s photo or video\u201d, observed: \u201cindividuals won\u2019t be subject to investigation or held accountable if they misconduct themselves or distort the truth, at least not in the same way a news network would (or should)\u201d (NL, M, 25). Another reproved: \u201cWhen they publish photos and videos by amateurs, my trust fades\u201d (NL, F, 26).", "Amongst the respondents resisting the inclination to align with either ordinary citizens or professionals on either side of this comparison were those who felt image integrity could not be prejudged. In some instances, this equivalence was expressed for positive reasons. \u201cI would trust ordinary people\u2019s photos/videos the same as a professional\u2019s because ordinary people can take extraordinary photos as well[,] they just don\u2019t get paid for it\u201d (CAN, F, 16a). Others believed both types served the same purpose, or that their respective provenance was incidental to their news value. Conversely, however, several respondents gave voice to their wariness about the relative trustworthiness of news images in the first place. \u201cActually I don\u2019t trust photos\u201d, a UK respondent stated. \u201cI know what photoshop can do to a picture. Video could be more convincing\u201d (UK, F, no age given). In the view of some, no image was innocent of vested interest or motivation. \u201cBias is something that happens all the time no matter where you look\u201d, a Canadian respondent maintained. \u201cMost things today are edited so you can\u2019t really trust either\u201d (CAN, M, 16b). In the case of some respondents, this amounted to a certain disdain, even cynicism. \u201cI distrust ordinary people\u2019s photos/videos the same as those taken by a professional, because both parties might have reasons to manipulate the footage (for money, fame etcetera)\u201d (NL, F, 21), a Dutch respondent argued. While ordinary citizens may be morally suspect in this regard, another warned, \u201cprofessionals can be corrupt or illegal or deceitful as well. Just because it is their job doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re more trustworthy\u201d (NL, F, 17). One UK respondent, explaining why she would not trust one more than the other, feared professionals \u201ccan show a video from a mobile camera on the news and say that someone sent it video to them, but actually it all can be a fake\u201d (UK, F, 25b). Even some of those expressing their faith in professionals signalled a degree of disillusionment. \u201cI always felt some kind of obedience to trust people who [trained] for this job\u201d, a Dutch respondent commented. \u201cThis is maybe why I have been fooled quite some times\u201d (NL, M, 16)."]}, {"sec_title": "Conclusions", "sec_content": ["In the years since news headlines first heralded the sudden popularity of camera phones, they have become such an ordinary feature of the everyday in Western countries that many would find it difficult to imagine their lives without them. Audience surveys would suggest this is particularly so with millennials; for example, a recent Pew (2014) study found that 83 per cent of 18\u201329-year-olds in the United States owned smartphones, the highest percentage of any demographic cohort in the country. Considered in conjunction with the billions of photos taken and shared worldwide, it is hardly surprising that this emphatic engagement with smartphone technology was widely apparent in the responses to our questionnaire, even in the hypothetical case of acting as a citizen witness in a crisis situation. In this article we have focused on the motivations behind\u2014and evaluations of\u2014such affordances and possibilities, as well as the perceived strengths and limitations of professional photojournalism in comparison with non-professional alternatives. Notwithstanding the previously mentioned caveats concerning the impracticality of extrapolating from such findings to characterise the predispositions of this demographic cohort more generally, we would suggest that the thematics discernible in our data helped to illuminate several distinctions of practice (real and imagined) shaped by experiential (personal beliefs and feelings), behavioural (ascribed actions), and communal or peer-group (normative evaluations) values and priorities.", "These distinctions were discernible in responses at several interrelated levels, not least with regard to the relative impetus or disincentive to capture imagery in unexpected, possibly dangerous circumstances. Despite the ordinariness of smartphone camera usage within our respondents\u2019 everyday lives, a concomitant sense of themselves bearing witness when confronted with a crisis situation could not be safely presumed in advance. In marked contrast with some of the more celebratory treatments of the social impacts engendered by smartphones\u2014\u201ceveryone is a photojournalist now\u201d\u2014our participants\u2019 responses revealed that such reactions were context-sensitive, with a range of factors informing their likely negotiation of actions considered appropriate to perform under such circumstances. Several tropes emerged in the responses, such as: a desire to share a personal perspective or experience with wider publics, a willingness to stand in for absent journalists, and a commitment to civic duty or related forms of obligation. This is not to deny that the prospect of recognition or financial considerations were conceded by some to be decisive, but in the main those respondents expressing a willingness to help secure visible evidence with their smartphones seemed motivated by more altruistic purposes. Reportorial aspirations were typically couched in qualified and conditional terms, however, with the importance of such evidence for police investigation widely upheld\u2014and resonating more strongly than its prospective newsworthy significance.", "Important differences of opinion arose regarding who was best placed to secure credible, trustworthy photographs or video of what was transpiring\u2014the professional or the amateur\u2014should they both be on the scene. The majority of respondents appeared to subscribe to the belief that the \u201craw images\u201d of the amateur were more believable because they were \u201cunedited\u201d, or at least less likely to be altered to an extent that called into question their veracity. Time and again professional imagery was criticised, including for the perceived distancing effects of its conventions where capturing emotive complexities was concerned (news professionals invoke their own biased agenda, some maintained, in marked contrast with the authentic spontaneity of the amateur). Still, the sharpest point of disquiet pertained to the acceptable limits of editing software, with the superior aesthetic qualities ascribed to professional imagery recurrently correlated with the subtle yet telling distortions rendered by the skilled application of Photoshop. Characterised by some respondents as \u201cairbrushing\u201d, \u201cmanipulation\u201d, \u201cdoctoring\u201d, \u201ctampering\u201d, and the like, considerable scepticism was expressed regarding photojournalists\u2019 abilities to relay imagery that was \u201crealistic\u201d or \u201ctrue-to-life\u201d while, at the same time, upholding the familiar, conventionalised protocols of the craft.", "Perhaps counter-intuitively, then, the very qualities signifying the visual authority of the professional photojournalist were most likely to invite suspicion, to varying degrees, particularly with respect to the ensuing imagery\u2019s truth-value (and thereby its intrinsic trustworthiness) in comparison with that proffered by citizens with smartphones. We have shown how differing perceptions of citizen engagement stretched across a continuum\u2014ranging from serving as a \u201cpublic eye\u201d to irresponsible \u201cdisaster tourists\u201d\u2014in uneven, sometimes contradictory ways. Yet the normative alignment of verisimilitude with the non-professional\u2019s efforts may be suggestive of a deeper discontent. Such a conclusion, at the very least, invites further reflection about how to establish deliberative spaces for dialogue and debate over the reinvigoration of photojournalism\u2019s reportorial commitments for tomorrow\u2019s participatory news cultures.
