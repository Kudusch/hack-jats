Many assume this approach differs from that of legacy newsrooms, which have historically kept the audience at arm\u2019s length. In this article, I argue that this distinction has blurred. In-depth interviews with reporters and editors at a daily newspaper (The Chicago Tribune) and a local news non-profit (City Bureau) reveal that: (1) both organizations are pursuing a more collaborative relationship with their audiences; and (2) this pursuit is ill-suited for the traditional mass audience approach to news production. I conclude that journalists aspiring to work more closely with the audience find greater success when that audience is narrow to begin with.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["For the past two decades, the news industry has struggled to overcome profound financial instability. Local newspapers in particular have faced huge drops in print advertising and subscription revenues, leading to staff cuts and closures (Nielsen 2015; Siles and Boczkowski 2012). In light of these circumstances, journalism researchers and stakeholders are turning their focus to news non-profits, an increasingly popular alternative to local news production (Ferrucci 2015c, 2017; Konieczna and Powers 2016; Mitchell et al. 2013; Rosentiel et al. 2016). News non-profits have rapidly spread across the United States (Mitchell et al. 2013), and most are only a few years old (Rosentiel et al. 2016). Though the future of the news industry remains marked with uncertainty, it appears likely that the non-profit news model will be a part of it.", "Many believe that a world where journalism stems from news non-profits rather than commercial newspapers would look very different from the present. Non-profit journalism combines aspects of traditional reporting (e.g., professional editors and reporters working to publish original content) with collaborations between foundations, community activists, and data scientists (Konieczna and Robinson 2014; Robinson 2011, 2014; Robinson and DeShano 2011). News non-profits tend to embrace \u201cpublic service journalism\u201d (Ferrucci 2017), an approach to news production that explicitly embraces strong, collaborative ties with the news audience. Public service journalists privilege direct communication with their audiences (e.g., in-person events, online conversations via social media platforms) in hopes of shifting news production from one-way lectures to two-way dialogues. This runs counter to legacy news organizations, which have historically been uninterested in interacting with or hearing from their readers (Gans 2004). Yet, as journalism\u2019s economic crisis continues, even traditional news publishers have begun altering their approach in order to survive. Might this include a similar attempt to improve the journalist/audience relationship? If so, how might this attempt differ from that of a non-profit news publisher?", "What follows is an investigation of these questions based on in-depth interviews with reporters and editors at two local news organizations in Chicago: a traditional newspaper (The Chicago Tribune), and a news non-profit (City Bureau). Findings reveal that, contrary to expectations about legacy newsrooms, both organizations are pursuing stronger, more collaborative relationships with the news audience. However, this pursuit occurs differently, and with different levels of success, depending on how each news organization conceptualizes the audience in the first place. City Bureau editors see Chicago as comprising multiple audiences separated by geography and socioeconomic conditions, and focus specifically on cultivating close ties with several of these groups. Tribune editors and reporters, on the other hand, generally conceive of their readers as one loosely collected mass of people that likely live in the Chicago area but can also include anyone with an internet connection. The paper\u2019s larger, more varied readership makes pursuing a more participatory relationship with the audience less intuitive and often more frustrating.", "These findings suggest that journalism\u2019s shift from ignoring to embracing audience input is not relegated to one type of news organization, but is instead occurring throughout the profession as a whole. More importantly, they indicate that the pursuit of a more collaborative relationship with the news audience is ill-suited for a traditional mass audience approach to news production. While City Bureau editors described encouraging interactions with their limited, carefully chosen audience, Tribune editors and reporters described exasperating and alienating experiences with a much broader group of people. In light of these findings, I conclude that journalists pursuing a more collaborative relationship with the news audience find greater success when they focus on narrower audiences to begin with. Doing so, however, increases audience fragmentation at a moment when many fear the news media environment is already hopelessly torn apart."]}, {"title": "News Production and the Audience", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the twentieth century, journalists working for commercial news publishers (e.g., daily newspapers, broadcast news stations) were relatively unconcerned with their audience \u201cand rejected feedback from it\u201d (Gans 2004, 230). Instead, journalists decided which stories to cover based on their professional judgment, and aspired to impress their editors rather than their readers (Boczkowski 2013). This indifference stems from the fact that, in a much more limited media environment, journalists working for well-known news brands could rightly assume their reporting would be widely received (Webster 2014). As a result, reporters and editors in commercial news organizations rarely considered their audience\u2019s preferences or backgrounds when making editorial decisions.", "As the twentieth century came to a close, this approach became untenable. First, the arrival of cable brought with it a much larger array of television options, fragmenting the broadcast news audience (Nadler 2016). Then, the advent of the internet led to drastic losses in print journalism advertising and subscription revenues (McChesney and Pickard 2011; Prior 2007; Seamans and Zhu 2014; Siles and Boczkowski 2012). Commercial news media suddenly had a financial incentive to question its detached attitude toward the audience, and to seek out an approach that would bring those audiences back (Nadler 2016; Williams and Delli Carpini 2011).", "It is within this current media environment that many journalism stakeholders and researchers have begun to argue that the news industry should take a stronger interest in the audience (Batsell 2015; Lewis, Holton, and Coddington 2014; Loosen and Schmidt 2012; McCollough, Crowell, and Napoli 2017; Mersey 2010). Advocates of this strategy believe that when journalists know more about how audiences interact with the news, they can more effectively create content that meets the audience\u2019s preferences and expectations. They argue that news publishers should begin identifying and keeping the audience in mind throughout the news production process, rather than simply publishing news and assuming that the audience will show up. One increasingly popular type of news production has aggressively taken up this approach: the non-profit news model."]}, {"title": "Non-Profit Journalism", "paragraphs": ["News non-profits seek funding from grants and donations rather than ad revenue, frequently partner with a variety of civic organizations in addition to more conventional newsrooms, and actively court audience participation (Felle 2016; Ferrucci 2015c; Konieczna and Robinson 2014; Ognyanova et al. 2013; Pickard and Stearns 2011; Rosentiel et al. 2016; Wenzel, Gerson, and Moreno 2016). Though non-profit journalism precedes the digital era, in the past few years it has begun to play a more prominent role in the news media landscape. Some news non-profits focus on specific subjects (e.g., criminal justice, climate change); many, however, seek to fill the local news void left by traditional, daily newspapers (Ferrucci 2015a, 2015b; Mitchell et al. 2013; Patel and McLellan 2012; Rosentiel et al. 2016). Local news non-profits have grown increasingly common, leading researchers to investigate their impact on the news environment and the communities they cover (Coates Nee 2013; Coates Nee 2013; Ferrucci 2015c; Konieczna and Powers 2016).", "These studies have found that the philosophy behind news non-profits bears a strong resemblance to public journalism, a failed movement in the 1990s where commercial news publishers attempted to improve their ties with their audiences (Ferrucci 2015c, 2017). Public journalism efforts attempted to engage communities, give citizens the power to shape the news agenda, present the news in an easily understood format, and galvanize readers (Charity 1995; Ferrucci 2015c; Glasser 1999; Rosen 1996). The news non-profit approach is similarly focused on better understanding and connecting with specific audiences in an attempt to empower citizens, which is why it has been recently dubbed public service journalism (Ferrucci 2015c). News non-profit journalists often aspire to engage marginalized communities, and they do so by attempting to not only report stories about these communities, but to them as well."]}, {"title": "From One, Many", "paragraphs": ["Public service journalism\u2019s emphasis on improving news coverage of and for specific communities speaks to an important development in news production more generally: the division of the news audience into multiple audiences. Commercial journalism has historically taken a \u201cmass audience\u201d approach to news production, where reporters and editors assumed a neutral, detached tone in order to appeal to as many people as possible (Webster 2014; Williams and Delli Carpini 2011). This resulted in reporters and editors focusing predominantly on their own demographic: educated, white, middle-class males (Epstein 1974; Fishman 1980; Tuchman 1978). As a result, news organizations have struggled to address women, minorities, lower-income groups, and those \u201con the fringes of society\u201d (Clarke 2014; Hess 2015; McChesney and Pickard 2011; Mersey 2010, 129; Nadler 2016; Richards 2013). News ethnographies throughout the twentieth century portray this oversight not as a malicious attempt to exclude specific populations, but as an unintended consequence of the news industry comprising a mostly homogenous group of people and treating its audience as a similarly homogenous mass (Fishman 1980; Gans 2004; Tuchman 1978).", "Non-profit news journalists, on the other hand, often explicitly acknowledge the existence of distinct audiences. Doing so allows them to focus primarily on improving their relationship with specific groups they believe have been underrepresented or left out by traditional news media. For example, the news non-profit One River, Many Stories focused specifically on engaging with citizens living near the St. Louis River in an attempt to \u201cbuild an alliance among the region\u2019s professional journalists, educators and citizen storytellers\u201d (\u201cAbout\u201d). This approach stems from the assumption that confining the audience to a small subsection of the total population makes it easier to pursue a more collaborative relationship with them. When a publication focuses on a specific demographic, it increases the likelihood of garnering more members from that group, but also of alienating anyone outside of it. As a result, this approach comes with a cost\u2014it limits the size of the potential audience. A smaller audience is incompatible with a media environment dependent on advertising dollars, but fits more naturally within the news industry\u2019s ongoing shift towards subscription and donation-based revenue models (Pfauth 2016; Vernon 2016; Williams 2016).", "More importantly, the pursuit distinct audiences instead of one mass audience might adversely affect democratic society by diminishing the ability for people to come together and discuss issues in shared public spaces (Katz 1996). Katz referred to this as \u201caudience segmentation,\u201d which he lamented would occur with the arrival of multiple broadcast channels (1996, 23). Within such a news media environment, audiences would grow more extreme in their views because they would not be exposed to conflicting viewpoints. Many fear that this is already occurring, and that the advent of partisan news that began with cable channels like Fox and MSNBC and has continued with websites like The Huffington Post and Drudge Report has allowed liberals and conservatives to confine themselves to news sources that align with their ideologies, while ignoring everything else (Jamieson and Cappella 2009; Pariser 2011; Stroud 2010, 2011). Currently, it seems this fear has not panned out (Gentzkow and Shapiro 2011; Napoli 2016; Nelson and Webster Forthcoming; Weeks, Ksiazek, and Holbert 2016). Even in a media environment of seemingly infinite choice, audiences continue to congregate among a few well-known brands like The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and ABC that have continued to publish news intended for a mass audience. However, assuming the desire to build stronger ties with the audience extends to the news industry as whole, this might very well change.", "In light of these circumstances, this project seeks to answer two questions. First, is the pursuit of a stronger relationship with the news audience confined solely to news non-profits, or has it spread to more traditional outlets as well? And is a small, niche audience necessary for a more collaborative journalist/audience relationship to be successful?", "With that, my research question is as follows: How do a news non-profit and a traditional newspaper conceptualize and pursue their audiences?", "How do a news non-profit and a traditional newspaper conceptualize and pursue their audiences?"]}, {"title": "Method", "paragraphs": ["My analysis draws on data collected through 29 in depth interviews with reporters and editors from both City Bureau and The Chicago Tribune. During the interviews, I asked a variety of questions to better understand how my subjects conceptualized and pursued their audiences.

The recordings were transcribed, and the transcriptions were analyzed using grounded theory to find recurring themes and patterns (Fleming 2014; Nelson and Lewis 2015). All but one subject agreed to allow me to me to use their name and title. Northwestern\u2019s Institutional Review Board (IRB) exempted all research involving human subjects in this study.", "The Chicago Tribune is the eleventh largest daily paper in the country (Lipinski 2016).

City Bureau began in early 2016 with a grant from the McCormick Foundation. Its model involves a core staff that oversees a rotating group of reporters as they produce investigative stories focused primarily on Chicago\u2019s South and West Side communities \u2014 areas that comprise an overwhelming portion of Chicago\u2019s black and Hispanic citizens (the South Side is over 90 percent black, and the West Side is 80 percent black or Hispanic) and that City Bureau\u2019s founders believe to be underreported by bigger name Chicago presses like the Tribune. City Bureau editors then partner with other outlets to co-publish these stories. City Bureau\u2019s reporting has appeared in traditional news publications like The Chicago Reader and The Guardian, as well as smaller, community presses like the Chicago Defender and the Chicago Reporter.", "I chose City Bureau because of its stated interest in redefining \u201cwhat local media means to a community\u201d (\u201cAbout\u201d), its focus on the city\u2019s minority neighborhoods, and its success thus far. Since it was founded, City Bureau has won prestigious journalism awards, and has been profiled in journalism blogs like Niemanlab, Columbia Journalism Review, and Mediashift (Dalton 2015; Lichterman 2016; Spinner 2016). Most recently, the staff successfully raised over $10,000 to build a \u201cpublic newsroom\u201d on Chicago\u2019s South Side and expand its operations, and received a $50,000 grant from Democracy Fund.", "As a small non-profit, City Bureau has only four principal staff members, all of whom are also founders. Two work for City Bureau full-time\u2014Editorial Director Darryl Holliday and Community Director Andrea Hart\u2014and two are part-time\u2014Editor Bettina Chang and the Operations Manager Harry Backlund. All four worked in local journalism prior to starting City Bureau: Hart covered suburban Chicago for Patch.com, Holliday covered Chicago for the Chicago Sun-Times and DNAinfo Chicago, Backlund is the founding publisher of a community newspaper on the city\u2019s south side, and Chang still works fulltime as a web editor for Chicago Magazine.

The results are divided into two sections: the first focuses on data collected from The Chicago Tribune, and the second on City Bureau.", "Interviews with Tribune reporters revealed that they generally do not write with a specific audience in mind, but instead with the hope of reaching as wide an audience as possible. The paper\u2019s reporters and editors see their potential audience as incredibly broad, so they focus more on reaching as many people as possible than they do on determining who might be excluded in that pursuit. When pressed to visualize their audience, reporters and editors frequently observed that Tribune readers comprise both urban and suburban residents of the Chicagoland area, as well as a portion of residents flung throughout the state of the Illinois. However, as Deputy Editorial Page Editor Marie Dillon points out, the audience might also include anyone who stumbles onto a Tribune article online, including people who live outside of the Midwest: You used to think it was your subscribers\u2014the people who paid for your paper and wanted to read what you had. But it\u2019s so much broader than that now. Almost anyone who sees a link to anything in your paper is going to react to it, and engage with it, and maybe share it.The fact that the Tribune\u2019s audience included such a wide range of demographics seemed to discourage reporters from conceptualizing their readers as any group in particular. Instead, reporters and editors described drawing on their own preferences and news judgment to determine what and how to report. As Travel Reporter Josh Noel said, \u201cTo me it\u2019s just like, is it a good story? Tell me a good story. As a consumer of news that\u2019s what I look for.\u201d", "You used to think it was your subscribers\u2014the people who paid for your paper and wanted to read what you had.

Almost anyone who sees a link to anything in your paper is going to react to it, and engage with it, and maybe share it.", "The Tribune\u2019s focus on reaching a mass audience was evident in the way its reporters and editors discussed online audience measurement data. In general, Tribune journalists said they draw on these data to understand how many people their content is reaching, as opposed to who those people are. Consistent with prior research (Clarke 2014; Mersey 2010; Nadler 2016), this focus on measures of audience size rather than any other category sometimes led editors to overlook the interests of minority communities in Chicago. Digital News Editor Randi Shaffer touched on this while discussing how the Tribune approaches coverage of Englewood, a South Side, mostly black neighborhood: For us on the web team, metrics are huge. They let us know what people are interested in, they let us know what we should report more on. And we\u2019re not on the ground. We\u2019re not out talking with the community.

While some at the paper believe they should communicate with and listen to the audience, others consider that outside of their responsibilities. There is little guidance from managers about what the ideal journalist/audience relationship should look like and how it should or should not be pursued. As a result, some described taking steps to communicate with readers via in-person events or social media platforms, while others were so discouraged by the vitriol they found in online comments to their articles that they admitted they rarely even looked at them. The uncertainty with which editors and reporters defined and discussed their relationship with their audience revealed an underlying tension between the Tribune staff\u2019s desire to not seem stuck in traditional ways of approaching the audience and an inability to reinvent the paper as a fundamentally different and much more audience-focused news organization.", "Those who did describe routinely communicating with readers, including education reporter Dawn Rhodes and columnist Heidi Stevens, who said they do so to answer questions about how stories were reported, or to clarify a point they feel has been lost on readers. As Stevens explained: It\u2019s a waste of the potential to tweet your stuff and Facebook post your stuff and then not go in there and answer for people\u2019s comments and questions. It\u2019s like having a room full of people who just listened to your conversation and then being like, \u201cI have nothing else to say to you people.\u201d It\u2019s like you\u2019re saying stuff to me. Now I\u2019m going to say stuff back. My Facebook page, under any of my columns, it\u2019s a conversation.Yet the same Tribune journalists who discussed taking steps to interact with the audience also volunteered examples where the audience angered or scared them. In a digital media environment, the ease with anyone can find a piece of content and then reach out to its author can have frightening consequences, as columnist Rex Huppke learned first-hand. He described how a political column he\u2019d written inspired the ire of right-wing extremists who came across the article when it was relinked on an extremist blog. They responded by aggressively bombarding Huppke with threats and vitriol. It was clear during the interview that he was still grappling with the lingering effects of the experience: It can make you gun shy sometimes. Because you\u2019re like, \u201cDo I want to walk into this shit storm? This is going to suck.\u201d\u2009\u2026\u2009I don\u2019t know that you had to consider that before when you were writing, and only The Chicago Tribune audience was reading you.

But when they all come after you at once\u2009\u2026\u2009it kind of gives you the chills a little bit.This anecdote gets at a disconcerting and often overlooked consequence of what happens when news organizations make it easier for the audience to contact journalists, and a reason why journalists writing for publications with a large, widespread readership may not want to interact with the audiences who are reading their work. As Rhodes explained, drawing on her own experience interacting with angry readers via Twitter, \u201cWe\u2019re kind of fighting this, almost like fighting a mob in a way.\u201d", "It\u2019s a waste of the potential to tweet your stuff and Facebook post your stuff and then not go in there and answer for people\u2019s comments and questions.

Both Stevens and Huppke mentioned feeling ambivalent about reading comments to their articles or responding to readers because they so often were discouraged by just how angry people were. Huppke touched on this topic while explaining his reluctance to converse more with readers on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter: I\u2019m not tremendously interactive on social media. I am a little bit, but more only with people that I kind of have gotten to know who are funny and whatever. Like I don\u2019t reply a lot, for a couple of reasons. One, I don\u2019t have time.

And because a lot of times you\u2019re just dealing with assholes who are trolls, so it\u2019s not worth acknowledging them.Interviews with reporters and editors revealed that those who did make efforts to interact with the audience felt better about interactions that occurred in more intimate or offline venues. For instance, Huppke said emails tended to be less crude than Facebook and Twitter comments, and Stevens said small, public events tended to be where the most civil audience engagement took place. Huppke called both Facebook and the Tribune\u2019s commenting pages places \u201cfor abuse and hatred and meanness,\u201d and said he\u2019s been encouraging his bosses to disable the ability for readers to comment. Stevens was more open to continuing correspondence via social media, but said the best interactions occurred in person: I do conversations a lot on comments and stories and Twitter. But the best way is really in person. I do a fair number of speaking engagements so a lot of women\u2019s groups will ask me to come and talk.\u2009\u2026\u2009That, honestly, is the best way to hear what\u2019s on people\u2019s minds.", "I\u2019m not tremendously interactive on social media.

For example, editors described one recently launched section called Blue Sky, which targets Chicago\u2019s growing community of tech entrepreneurs. The staff involved with this section regularly host or attend events in Chicago where they interact with Blue Sky readers, who comprise people in the Chicago startup community. They also use an audience engagement platform called Hearken to solicit questions about what stories to cover from the audience. Blue Sky Editor Andrea Hanis put her audience strategy simply: \u201cWe talk to people\u2009\u2026\u2009all the time.\u201d And unlike Huppke and Stevens, Hanis seemed to have only positive things to say about these sorts of audience exchanges. Most notably, she described using social media to hear from or communicate with her audience with much less ambivalence than the Tribune columnists writing for much larger audiences: I actually use Twitter a lot for ideas. I think when you\u2019re covering a niche audience, it\u2019s a fantastic way to find out what they\u2019re talking about and what they care about, so I find that to be a really good source of ideas.In short, The Chicago Tribune generally maintains a mass audience approach to the news audience, which leads to the privileging of stories that appeal to a large audience, rather than a specific audience. This has frustrating and sometimes frightening consequences for Tribune writers attempting a more collaborative or interactive relationship with the audience, especially when faced with angry or threatening readers expressing their rage via social media. However, Tribune staff working for sections that deviate from the mass audience approach to target niche audiences (e.g., Blue Sky) report a more communicative, less disdainful relationship between themselves and the small, intentionally chosen audience they are pursuing.", "I actually use Twitter a lot for ideas.

City Bureau\u2019s founders described their potential news audience as split between the minority South and West Side communities that tend to be overlooked by Chicago\u2019s established news outlets, and the political elites whose attention must sometimes be summoned so that wrongs within these communities can be corrected. Holliday put this separation bluntly by referring to Chicago\u2019s media ecosystem as \u201ca segregated industry.\u201d", "Because of City Bureau\u2019s unique publishing and non-profit structure, it has the ability to partner with different publications without considering which will bring in larger audiences or more revenue. Instead, these decisions are made primarily in terms of which community should the story reach. As Holliday explained, while there are some instances where City Bureau editors would like a story to reach the global, mass audience pursued by a publication like The Guardian, there are other instances where they would prefer a story to reach a narrower community of people more easily reached by a small community press like The Chicago Defender: We did a story about West Side churches moving into West Side streets\u2009\u2026\u2009you can\u2019t make a commercial corridor if you have like 15 churches on a block.\u2009\u2026\u2009That story is not a Guardian story.\u2009\u2026\u2009It\u2019s a story that like people in the neighborhood pick up and they say like, \u201cOh, this is my block.\u2009\u2026\u2009Now we can talk about this.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t work in The Guardian. It wouldn\u2019t be the same impact.\u2009\u2026\u2009And there are some times where we\u2019re trying to like call the mayor, the police chief to attention, you know, like we\u2019re trying to call accountability for people to leverage whatever power they have.\u2009\u2026\u2009Those stories, that\u2019s a Guardian story.In other words, City Bureau editors are quick to acknowledge that the news audience within these communities differs from the news audience outside of them. As a result, their reporting and publication decisions are based on first finding underreported stories about the South and West Sides of Chicago, and then determining if those stories should be directed at the people who live in these areas, or the people who live outside those areas. In short, City Bureau\u2019s unconventional approach to publishing allows it the unique flexibility to choose its intended audience on a story-by-story basis.", "We did a story about West Side churches moving into West Side streets\u2009\u2026\u2009you can\u2019t make a commercial corridor if you have like 15 churches on a block.\u2009\u2026\u2009That story is not a Guardian story.\u2009\u2026\u2009It\u2019s a story that like people in the neighborhood pick up and they say like, \u201cOh, this is my block.\u2009\u2026\u2009Now we can talk about this.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t work in The Guardian.

This knowledge stems from a combination of intuition, personal experience, and audience data. For instance, City Bureau editors have seen Chicago Public Radio\u2019s audience research, so they know that outlet can be tapped to reach a mostly white, North Side audience. When City Bureau editors want to target Chicago\u2019s political elites, they partner with the Chicago Reader because, as Holliday explained, \u201cWe know that in the mayor\u2019s press box every day he gets the Reader.\u201d When they want to reach the city\u2019s South Side, they publish in the South Side Weekly, a print, non-profit newspaper that is distributed on the South Side. And when they want to reach a mass audience, they partner with Chicago Public Radio or The Guardian. More often than not, however, City Bureau focuses on smaller, community presses like South Side Weekly, The Chicago Defender, and Austin Weekly News.", "City Bureau draws on a number of means of building strong, collaborative relationships with its South and West Side audiences. First, and most notably, the organization hosts events, like its weekly Public Newsrooms, that invite community members to hear from and interact with City Bureau journalists as well as other news media professionals. Because City Bureau\u2019s newsroom is located in the South Side neighborhood Hyde Park, these events occur within one of the communities that City Bureau is attempting to engage with and report on. Furthermore, when City Bureau publishes an article, its staff also works with the reporters of the story to coordinate events within the community the story is focused in an attempt to oversee an in-person conversation about the story\u2019s topic. Holliday summarized City Bureau\u2019s community focus in this way: What stories look like when they involve the community I think is\u2014it involves being in person and it involves having a meeting, a workshop, an event and say, like, \u201cPlease come. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, but how can you affect that? How can you influence it? Who do you know that we should be talking to? Should we be talking to you, your neighbor, the guy who\u2019s a complete\u2014no journalist has ever spoken to, but like who everybody on the block knows?\u201d\u2009\u2026\u2009How can you really bring people into the process as opposed to just laying out the agenda and saying, \u201cWell, this is what we\u2019re going to do in perpetuity.\u2019 City Bureau\u2019s Public Newsrooms are intended to reach out to and empower community members who feel disconnected from the stories told about them and their neighborhoods by other news organizations. City Bureau staff described their hopes that these events would lure out South and West Side residents who had previously been disengaged with civic life and were interested in changing that. However, as Editor Bettina Chang pointed out, so far this has not been the case. Instead, attendees tend to be people who are already very engaged in public life on behalf of these communities: We definitely right now get the people who are hyper-engaged. We get a lot of people who work for nonprofits or in the social/public sector kind of stuff. Every once in a while we do get someone who is like, \u201cI just came. Somebody told me to come. My sorority sister told me to come, so I\u2019m here.\u2019 We\u2019re really hoping to get those people involved. We\u2019ve gotten really good feedback from those people because I think they expected the least, but they got the most.In other words, for now it seems that City Bureau\u2019s attempt to build a more collaborative relationship with its audience is more likely to succeed with those already invested in City Bureau\u2019s mission and the communities it has chosen to focus on. Expanding the audience to include disengaged citizens poses a more difficult challenge.", "What stories look like when they involve the community I think is\u2014it involves being in person and it involves having a meeting, a workshop, an event and say, like, \u201cPlease come.

We\u2019ve gotten really good feedback from those people because I think they expected the least, but they got the most.", "In addition to these public events, City Bureau also offers two training initiatives meant to both increase community awareness of the organization and teach aspiring journalists how to contribute to the news production process. The first of these initiatives partners City Bureau reporters with a non-profit that offers media production education to South and West side young people. The second, called Documenters, offers community members basic journalism training needed for them to attend public meetings (e.g., school board meetings, police board meetings, city council meetings), and live tweet or blog about them. As Community Director Andrea Hart explained, \u201cIt\u2019s really true to the sort of public journalism school model of like, \u2018Okay, you have an interest in civic issues in your neighborhood\u2014let\u2019s help you build that out.\u2019\u201d", "Finally, City Bureau maintains an online presence and communicates with its audience via social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Taken together, these efforts reveal City Bureau to be primarily focused on explicitly building a strong, collaborative relationship with a small subset of Chicago residents. Editors at City Bureau believe that a disconnect exists between Chicago\u2019s traditional, established journalism brands and its minority communities, and seek to address this disconnect by reporting on issues that affect these communities specifically, and then utilizing a novel publishing model to point these stories either at the audiences within these communities or at audiences outside of them. However, publishing stories is only one piece of City Bureau\u2019s audience outreach. The other, equally laborious pieces of this process include live events, journalism training, and online interactions. Because City Bureau is not a daily news operation, its staff is able to devote much of its time to planning and executing these more audience-focused initiatives. And because City Bureau is so explicitly focused on specific communities within Chicago, determining who its staff should target with both their news coverage and audience interactions is a relatively straightforward process."]}, {"title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["These results reveal that a stronger journalist/audience relationship is a goal that is being pursued not just by news non-profits, but by more traditional news brands as well. Though The Chicago Tribune and City Bureau are drastically different in many key ways\u2014including size, age, circulation, and mission\u2014employees within both expressed a desire to communicate with audiences in order to improve both the quality of news each organization provides, as well as to benefit those for whom these news stories are provided. These findings suggest that the distinction between how innovative news non-profits and more traditional news organizations pursue and consider the audience has begun to blur. Though the Tribune historically kept the audience at arm\u2019s length, its reporters and editors described an increasing interest in using live events and digital technology to establish a more conversational relationship between news provider and consumer.", "The Tribune is not alone. Many newsrooms now encourage their reporters to interact with readers via social media platforms or live events. In fact, a growing number employ \u201cengagement editors\u201d tasked with corresponding with readers on social media platforms (Powers 2015). Furthermore, traditional news outlets like the The Washington Post, the BBC, and NPR are also increasingly adopting audience engagement tools like Hearken, Groundsource, and Coral Project, which allow these organizations to solicit questions and comments from readers to help determine what stories get reported. The motivations for this pursuit may vary: organizations like City Bureau focus on increasing collaboration with minority communities in order to improve their agency in the stories told about them, while Tribune editors and reporters in some cases seek to make their own reporting more comprehensible to readers, and in other cases to cultivate a sense of community among Chicagoans working in a similar industry.", "These findings also show that, regardless of the underlying motivations, pursuing a more collaborative relationship with the news audience is ill-suited with a mass audience approach to news production. Tribune columnists and reporters complained about the vitriol and mob mentality they faced when attempting to engage with audience members online, while the Tribune\u2019s Blue Sky team and City Bureau\u2019s founders reported no such qualms. This project is limited in that neither the Tribune nor City Bureau seemed entirely sure how to describe what the ideal journalism/audience relationship would look like, making it impossible to determine whether or not either organization had achieved this goal. However, that does not diminish the two main findings of this project: first, that both traditional and public service journalism organizations are making attempts to listen to and interact with news audiences, and second, that those tasked with targeting niche audiences were more encouraged by their attempts than those focused on reaching a much wider readership.", "Two decades ago, Katz sounded the alarm for what audience segmentation would do to democratic society. He worried that increasing media choice would lead to the disappearance of a shared cultural space where citizens could gather to hear and discuss the same information (Katz 1996). Yet, my findings suggest that segmentation might be the key to building strong bonds between news media providers and the audience. Tribune columnists and reporters writing for the paper\u2019s general readership faced disappointments and frustrations when attempting to interact with a mass audience, while both the Tribune\u2019s Blue Sky and City Bureau editors reported positive exchanges of story ideas and information when communication was confined to specific, niche groups. Furthermore, confining conceptualizations of the audience to narrowly determined communities freed City Bureau and Blue Sky journalists to pursue story ideas that would most likely resonate with these distinct groups without worrying if others would find them interesting. Assuming the goal of building stronger bonds with the audience continues to grow, news publishers pursuing this goal will find more incentive to segment their audience into distinct groups rather than pursue the audience as one loosely connected mass.", "This raises an important question: What will civil society lose when journalism\u2019s understanding of the public changes to one that is narrower, involved, and community focused? On the one hand, there are some who believe this change will restore public trust in journalism and give agency to marginalized communities who until now have felt excluded from their own news stories. Doing so, however, might further polarize society by leaving citizens no opportunity to interact with those of differing backgrounds or perspectives. Extreme political polarization already exists within the United States and across the globe, with liberals and conservatives disagreeing not just about policies, but about \u201cbasic facts\u201d (Bump 2016; Doherty, Kiley, and Johnson 2016), despite the fact that a few news brands still comprise an overwhelming majority of the news audience. If all news media becomes targeted at specific groups, will public life grow even more fragmented and polarized? Many assume that improving the relationship between journalism and the audience will have nothing but positive consequences for civic engagement and democracy. The truth may be more complicated."]}, {"title": "DISCLOSURE STATEMENT", "paragraphs": ["No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."]}], "references": [{"title": "Creative Destruction: An Exploratory Study of How Digitally Native News Nonprofits are Innovating Online Journalism Practices", "year": "2013", "journal": "International Journal on Media Management", "volume": "15", "authors": [{"name": "Coates Nee Rebecca.", "first_name": "Coates", "last_name": "Rebecca."}]}, {"title": "Social Responsibility Theory and the Digital Nonprofits: Should the Government aid Online News Startups?", "year": "2014", "journal": "Journalism: Theory, Practice \\& Criticism", "volume": "15", "authors": [{"name": "Coates Nee Rebecca.", "first_name": "Coates", "last_name": "Rebecca."}]}, {"title": "Digital Watchdogs?
