We discuss the key characteristics of the German public service broadcasting system and compare the quantity of foreign affairs news in evening news programs on the flagship public service (ARD and ZDF) and private channels (RTL and SAT.1) from 2001 to 2007. We find that while the amount of foreign affairs new ebbs and flows, it remains substantial and within the range of 40\u201350 percent of the programs on both the public service and the private channels. We then compare programs in Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, United Kingdom, South Africa, United States and on transnational Arabic channels, for one year from April 2007 to April 2008, to assess what regions are covered and what predicts foreign news. Geographic proximity and national interest were shown to be important factors in explaining the regional focus of foreign news in these countries and outlets.

Research on trends in the US news environment illustrates decline in the number of newspapers across the country, declining sales among those that survive, and decreasing coverage of the rest of the world on main evening television news programs in the decade before and since the Cold War ended (Norris, 1995). Despite this decline, there are occasional high points of international reporting that do garner attention apart from natural disasters. US television news coverage of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the months thereafter influenced US perceptions of Germany (Semetko et al., 1992) and, more recently, soft news has influenced public opinion about US foreign policy (Baum, 2003).", "In this issue of Journalism Studies, Jay Hamilton (2010) points to a reduction in international news in the United States of a particular kind: \u201cpublic affairs coverage by experienced reporters whose stories are bundled with domestic news and consumed by a mass audience,\u201d in other words, less foreign affairs news in the main evening news programs. Hamilton argues that due to the lower fixed costs of operating a news outlet on the Internet or on cable television \u201cnews has become unbundled.\u201d The \u201cgreater variety in offerings in terms of the topics covered and approaches offered [and] dispersion of the audience across outlets means that quality may be lowered because of lower revenues generated by smaller average audiences.\u201d", "The same structured lower costs for unbundled news also exist in Germany where, like the United States, there is a high Internet penetration rate1 and a wide variety of television news outlets. Germany has had private television channels competing with the public service broadcasting channels since the mid-1980s. Germany also has a strong public service broadcasting system that caters to a large proportion of the overall market, mandates news organizations to report on the rest of the world each day, and also provides the resources to deliver that coverage in flagship news programs daily. There is more space in the prime-time schedules for flagship news programs and thus more potential foreign news stories to find their way into the programs.", "In this article, we discuss the evolution of international television news reporting in Germany, where it is today and the direction it may be headed in the future. We argue that Germany's long history with international news, its location in the heart of Europe and shared borders with nine nations, and its post-World War II public service broadcasting system all contribute to what is today a substantial amount of international news on the evening news. We argue that it is not possible to generalize from the US case, as Hamilton's article might lead one to assume that unbundled news means less foreign news.", "We begin with a review of the key features of Germany's public service broadcasting system and the challenges faced by the public service channels since private or commercial channels arrived in the mid-1980s. We then discuss the volume of foreign news coverage on public and private channels, based on data over the past eight years. We also show that international news occupies a substantially larger share of the evening news in Germany than in the United States and several other countries, based on data from a recent one-year period. We then look at the regional focus of foreign news in these countries to explain what predicts foreign news."]}, {"sec_title": "From Gutenberg to Universal Access", "sec_content": ["International news has been prominent in Germany since Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in the city of Mainz in the fifteenth century. After much experimentation among German-speaking states in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a federal structure emerged as the nation state of Germany in 1871, and the population's appetite for world news has been measured for more than three centuries (Wilke, 1987). Today, Germans are among the most avid readers of newspapers across the entire European Union (EU), and like their EU counterparts the majority turns to television news programs for information about the most important developments each day. The construction of reality by Germany's news media, in the form of analyzing the contents, uses and effects of news, has long been the subject of scholarly research (Pfetsch, 2001; Schulz, 1976, 1997).", "In the aftermath of World War II, Germany's television landscape, like that of other European countries, was dominated by public service broadcasting. West European public service broadcasting was rooted in each nation state's political and cultural context, fulfilling its mission of \u201csustaining and renewing the society's characteristic cultural capital and cement\u201d (Blumler, 1992, p. 11). Different funding arrangements existed in the different European states. In the early 1980s research commissioned for the British Government's Peacock Committee on Financing the BBC compared Britain and the United States to six European nations, including what was then called West Germany, and found common trends and pressures, and a greater range and quality of programming in stronger public service systems (Blumler et al., 1986).", "Legislation and the regulatory environment in the EU and each EU member country also impact the development and position of public service broadcasting. In the United Kingdom, for example, the government passed Broadcasting or Communications Acts in 1990, 1992 1996 and 2003, which had significant consequences for television's financial and organizational structures and regulatory regimes (see Franklin, 1997 which offers a detailed analysis of the 1990\u20131996 period; Crisell, 2006). There also have been two significant reports from the House of Lords dealing with ownership and more (see House of Lords Select Committee on Communications, 2008a, 2008b). The United Kingdom introduced Ofcom as the new overarching regulator in 2003, now the \u2018one stop\u2019 responsible for what had formerly been the work of five regulatory bodies: the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the Independent Television Commission, the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel), the Radio Authority, and the Radiocommunications Agency.

Due to the experience of totalitarian control of broadcasting, the post-World War II German model of public broadcasting has been guided by the principle of \u201cdistance from the government,\u201d2 which is based on Article 30 of the German Constitution. Control of broadcasting devolved to the German states, which shape the broadcasting landscape by the means of inter-state treaties.

Until then only the ARD program had been broadcast nationwide. The states of Hamburg and Hessen filed a lawsuit to stop this plan, which they perceived as an infringement of their sovereignty in cultural affairs, and the Court struck down the plan. The new second channel, which ultimately became the ZDF, was established by the states in March 1961. In its decision the Constitutional Court underlined the extraordinary importance of broadcasting for the political system. As radio and TV contribute to the formation of public opinion, the broadcasting system must ensure access to relevant information. This, in the opinion of the Constitutional Court, did not only pertain to information programs but to fictional and entertainment programs as well (BVerfG, 1961).", "Until 1981 the legal framework did not allow for any private channels. The emergence of private TV channels elsewhere in Europe in the late 1970s and early 1980s ultimately led to their development in Germany. In its second guiding decision from 1981, the Constitutional Court paved the way for the \u201cDual System\u201d of broadcasting in Germany (BVerfG, 1981). It underlined the privileged position of public broadcasters, but at the same time bound them to provide the public with a basic program that addresses informational uses to a wide extent.5 Moreover, the decision bound the public broadcasters to establish plurality of opinions in its programming. This plurality is to be guaranteed through the supervision of the broadcasters by broadcasting councils that are required to reflect plurality of opinions in the composition of their membership. The broadcasting councils elect the directors of the public broadcasting stations.", "While the concrete composition of the broadcasting councils differs from state to state (Engel, 2009), most councilors are affiliated with political parties, primarily to the catch-all parties CDU/CSU and the SPD. In 2009, for instance, the Administrative Board of the ZDF comprised four First Ministers of German Federal States, one former First Minister and the Federal Secretary of State for Culture, while the other eight members have political backgrounds as well; out of the 77 members of the Television Council of the ZDF, which elects the Director, 72 are selected from the political parties (Hanfield, 2009; ZDF, 2010a, 2010b).", "The domination of the public broadcasters by the largest political parties has led to a heated public debate in Germany, when the Administrative Board of ZDF declined to prolong the contract of ZDF Editor-in-Chief Klaus Brender in spring 2010. The First Minister of the State of Hessen and CDU member, Roland Koch, was a vociferous critic of Brender. Koch blamed ZDF's Editor-in-Chief for the decline in ratings of the main evening news show heute (Bild-Zeitung, 2009). But most commentators traced the decision back to the political line of Brender, which fell foul of the CDU majority in the Administrative Board (Hanfield, 2009). The public debate on the political domination of public broadcasting even triggered the publication of an open letter by 35 experts in constitutional law, who qualified the removal of Brender as \u201can overt attempt to oust an independent journalist and to strengthen the influence of party politics\u201d (FAZ, 2009).6 Public broadcasting in Germany therefore is formally independent, but the influence of the two large political parties, parties that are leading both the federal government and the state-level governments as well, extends a long way into the public broadcasting organizations."]}, {"sec_title": "Constitutionally Mandated Freedom of Broadcasting", "sec_content": ["The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany guarantees the right of individuals to obtain information \u201cfreely from generally accessible sources\u201d (ARD, 2010)7 and the \u201cfreedom of reporting by means of broadcasts\u201d is constitutionally mandated.

Since the arrival of privately owned channels in the mid-1980s, audiences moved across the four major channels and over 40 free over-the-air channels. Households also have the opportunity to purchase additional packages for Turkish, Arabic, English and other programming for monthly subscription. With the introduction of private channels in Germany, there were complaints voiced about the rise of entertainment in German television news (Pfetsch, 1996). \u201cInfotainment\u201d was a term coined to describe the merging of information and entertainment genres and this was also evident in neighboring EU countries (Brants and Neijens, 2001).

The analysis of the content structure of the news programs underlines these findings. Compared to the news programs on the private TV stations, the main evening news, especially the ARD's Tagesschau, are more successful in accomplishing their mission in the field of political information (Daschmann, 2009, p. 264). These structural comparisons of public and private news programs do not provide an assessment of the absolute quality of the news programs, however.", "As public broadcasters have struggled with rising cost, the production of information programs has come under severe constraints. This has been reflected for instance in the curtailment of airtime for current affairs programs Panorama, Monitor, Report Mainz, Report M\u00fcnchen, Kontraste and Fakt by 15 minutes at the beginning of 2006 (Spiegel Online, 2006).", "Another field of rising concern has been foreign news. ARD still stresses the wide range of its net of foreign correspondents, which comprises 26 foreign studios. Foreign news has been an important feature of German TV news programs for several reasons, including the high level of cultural and economic relations in Europe, the relative small size of the country, the strong export position of German business and the high number of German tourists to international locations. Against this background the crisis of foreign news that has been detected by German journalists themselves attains a political dimension as well (Mukke, 2008). With the breakdown of the post-war system and the opening of the Western and Eastern blocks to the world, up-to-date and in-depth information about the world beyond the borders has become even more essential for orientation in a complex and rapidly changing world."]}, {"sec_title": "Public Service Broadcasting and International News", "sec_content": ["In addition to news programs, both ARD and ZDF produced educational programs that focused on political and social development in foreign countries.

Truth was described by journalists and scholars alike as the first victim of war, with outrage expressed at the measures taken by the United States and allied forces to control information which effected the portrayal of war on German TV. The dominance of CNN and official US footage in the German newscasts was seen as a serious problem. By 2003, with the buildup to the Iraq war, both private and public channels in Germany decided to put their own correspondents into the region. Only one, RTL, a leading private channel, actually \u201cembedded\u201d a journalist with the troops while the others kept their reporters outside of the theater of war. Embedded reporting raised questions about the independence of journalists to report the news accurately in 2003 (Cortell et al., 2009). The overall performance of German channels was strongly criticized in Germany afterwards for a lack of context and background information, among other reasons.", "This debate about the role of journalists in war overshadowed the ongoing discussion about the quality and quantity of foreign news in Germany. Through its academy in Tutzing, Bavaria, the Evangelical Lutheran Church hosted a public conference that brought together scholars and practitioners to discuss news quality.12 The conference crossed traditional boundaries between scholars and practitioners by bringing both together as presenters and audience members to consider the problems and prospects of televised foreign news under the critical title: \u201cOnly crisis, war, and catastrophes?\u201d (Cippitelli and Schwanebeck, 2003). The public service broadcasting organizations then defended themselves by commissioning a report which came to more positive conclusions than the title of the conference (Kruger, 2003).", "Since then, economic challenges have come to shape the debate about the news in Germany. Public broadcasters, television in particular (ARD and ZDF), have reduced their network of foreign correspondents, which led to strong criticism from both TV journalists and independent experts. More recently, the head of ZDF's foreign news department was asked some tough questions in an interview with the left-wing German daily newspaper TAZ about the alleged decline of quality (TAZ, 2009). Several studies were published that criticized German TV channels for the following deficiencies in foreign news, all of which in the German language begin with the letter \u201cK\u201d: Concentration on crisis, war, catastrophes, disease, crime and corruption. In her chapter in the volume that was published from the Tutzing conference, award-winning ARD broadcaster and author Sonia Seymour Mikich noted that the dominant characteristic of foreign news was the triviality of the content (Mikich, 2003). Studies of special format programs came to similar conclusions: developing nations and whole continents on the periphery, in particular, were covered only intermittently even in the special programs on German television (Breckl, 2006).", "Our review of Germany's public service broadcasting system, its mandates and challenges, and the debates about quality in routine news periods as well as in times of war and crisis, suggests that in comparison with the United States, Germany provides a national forum for critically assessing its broadcasting system and a better opportunity structure for citizens to become informed, educated and entertained. While many German scholars and practitioners may be dissatisfied with some of the content of Germany's foreign news coverage, the public broadcasting organizations still maintain bureaus around the world to deliver world news each day to German audiences as part of their mission and role in society. The state and the taxpayers provide some of the funds to support this work.", "Germany's public service broadcasting infrastructure and support for the delivery of foreign news to German audiences stands in stark contrast to the United States where networks are struggling to maintain foreign news coverage. In an effort to reduce costs, CBS followed other networks and in 2010 closed all but one of its international bureaus and laid off dozens of journalists. US networks now rely on other means of gathering foreign news, each of which has disadvantages in comparison with having a seasoned professional on the ground in a local bureau. Examples of the new approaches to gathering foreign news include partner organizations such as Rupert Murdoch's Fox and Sky, stringers with digicams, and the more expensive option\u2014to fly in a network reporter and film crew to cover breaking events."]}, {"sec_title": "Germany Compared", "sec_content": ["How do German television news programs compare in their reporting on foreign affairs?

In the United States, the Middle East ranked first (40 percent), far ahead of East Asia (18 percent) and Europe (17 percent).

The study of international or foreign news has been the focus of research for several decades. The work of Galtung and Ruge (1965), based on the Norwegian press, has been widely cited for setting forth the first list of news values that determine whether an event will make it into the news. Subsequent seminal studies point to the routine practices involved in collecting and disseminating news, the characteristics of reporters and their news organizations, and variation across countries in terms of societal values (see, for example, Patterson and Donsbach, 1996; Shoemaker and Reese, 1996; Weaver, 1998).", "A cross-national comparative study of the factors that determined the news in 10 countries around the world found that \u201cnews and newsworthiness\u201d are in fact \u201ctwo distinct theoretical concepts\u201d (Shoemaker and Cohen, 2006, p. 335), and that both complexity and intensity contribute to newsworthiness. International news on television, whether verbal or visual, rates as highly prominent and highly complex, and was described as almost always newsworthy (Shoemaker and Cohen, 2006, p. 351). In the one-year period for which we compared foreign news across countries and outlets here, from April 2007 to April 2008, the data suggest that geographic proximity and national interest are also important factors in explaining the regional focus of foreign news. For the European countries, South Africa, and the Middle East, the surrounding region was most often the focus of foreign news; with the exception of the United Kingdom, which appeared more like the United States in its regional focus due to the presence of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "In sum, our data suggest two more specific conclusions when comparing Germany and the United States. First, Germany and the United States are quite different in the amount of foreign news provided daily as a proportion of stories in flagship news programs. Second, Germany and the United States are somewhat similar in that when foreign news is reported, geographic proximity and national interest are factors that help to explain the content."]}, {"sec_title": "Discussion", "sec_content": ["The greater visibility of foreign news on flagship television news programs in Germany raises questions about the ability to generalize from the US case as described by Jay Hamilton earlier in this issue. Public service broadcasting in Germany, like health care, has long been supported by state subsidies, while the United States continues to struggle with the still unfolding consequences of letting the market decide.17 The consequences of the same market and technological developments (read \u2018unbundled news\u2019) are not as dramatic in Germany because of its strong public service broadcasting system.", "Hamilton (2010) argues that audience demand for foreign news in the United States is low because of a lack of education and familiarity with the complexities of foreign institutions, cultures and conflicts. But what came first\u2014the lack of education or the lack of information in US television news? And where have the educated and hungry for complexity gone? It turns out that National Public Radio has seen its ratings surge over the past decade as traditional TV news and newspapers have dumbed down, though this growth in ratings still does not necessarily translate into financial success for quality news outlets (see McClennan, 2009).", "In Germany, the substantial proportion of the programs devoted to foreign news stories suggests that audiences from all educational backgrounds continue to appreciate foreign news, especially on the public channels.18 Even if ratings were to decline dramatically for evening news programming, the public service broadcasting mission remains very important in Germany and still shapes how prime-time should be defined. In a 2008 interview, ARD chairman Frits Raff said \u201cratings do not dictate \u2026 we will continue to support formats with good timeslots which may not necessarily achieve the highest ratings\u201d (Raff, 2008).", "Germany has a longstanding and strong public service ethos that stresses the importance of bringing the major events from around the world into the news each day even when coverage of important domestic events such as election campaigns would push foreign news off the agenda in other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom (Semetko, 1996). Public service broadcasting may even have initially raised the bar for private channels in Germany which continue to devote a comparatively large share of the programs to foreign news, even though the channels are not subsidized nor bound by the same rules. Although feeling the pressures of competition, the two public channels, ARD and ZDF, still retain substantial though unequal governmental support in the form of license fees, sponsorship and advertising.", "Germany has the largest population of any EU country and by extension the largest media market in the EU. The quality of public service broadcasting in Germany, as in the rest of the EU countries, will continue to be the subject of debate because it is a public good and because it draws on public resources. It is a debate that citizens in the United States will not experience."]}], "references": [{"title": "\u201cBroadcasting Finance and Programmeme Quality: an international review\u201d", "year": "1986", "journal": "European Journal of Communication", "volume": "1", "authors": [{"name": "Blumler Jay", "first_name": "Blumler", "last_name": "Jay", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Brynin Malcolm", "first_name": "Brynin", "last_name": "Malcolm", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Nossiter Tom J.", "first_name": "Nossiter", "last_name": "J.", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "\u201cThe infotainment of \u201cpolitics\u201d", "year": "2001", "journal": "Political Communication", "volume": "15", "authors": [{"name": "Brants Kees", "first_name": "Brants", "last_name": "Kees", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}, {"name": "Neijens Peter", "first_name": "Neijens", "last_name": "Peter", "affiliation": "", "orcid": "", "role": ""}]}, {"title": "\u201cWhy Embed?
