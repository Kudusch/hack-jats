Given the trend in the UK newspaper industry towards closure and retrenchment of their local and regional press titles, it is perhaps understandable that policy-makers have shifted their gaze to these sites. This article examines the viability of hyperlocal news services with a particular focus on those that are independently owned and managed. Such operations often have a longevity that sits in contrast to a number of failed attempts by major media organisations to operate in the hyperlocal space. Yet many of the business models that underpin these sites seem precarious, often benefiting from a degree of self-exploitation. Drawing on 35 interviews with hyperlocal news publishers from across the UK, this article argues that publishers draw upon a civic discourse in order to make sense of their practice. This framing may limit the potential to develop economic sustainability and risks alienating policy-makers keen to work with an idealised \u201cfictive\u201d hyperlocal entrepreneur.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["\u201cHyperlocal\u201d publishing in the United Kingdom (UK) has been a topic for discussion amongst media commentators (Greenslade 2007) and media regulators (Ofcom 2009, 2012) for a number of years. The growth in local news websites with a community orientation has been lauded by organisations close to media policy-makers. The civically minded consultants Talk About Local (2011) see themselves as giving \u201cpeople the simple skills and support to find a powerful online voice for their community\u201d, whilst enterprise-focused investors such as Nesta have commissioned several reports about the phenomenon (Radcliffe 2012, 2015; Nesta and Kantar Media 2013) and invested their own funds in capacity-building initiatives. The more recent involvement of the Carnegie Trust has seen further investments of funds but also a more direct appeal to the British government for support and recognition to the sector, with calls for reviews to a skewed media regulatory climate in order \u201cto start levelling the playing field on financial support\u201d (Carnegie UK Trust 2014, 14). These interventions result in hyperlocal media being variously framed as: a potential saviour of local journalism, an emergent area of the internet economy and a mechanism to strengthen community cohesion. It is seemingly a space in which large media organisations (Guardian Media Group, Local World and Tindle Newspapers have all had endeavours in this space), individual business entrepreneurs and the amateur enthusiast can all see opportunity. To a degree, hyperlocal media sits refreshingly in contrast to the on-going \u201cnarratives of decline\u201d (McNair 2002, 9) around the local press whereby the critical perspective on the press is almost always pessimistic. Hyperlocal's promise is articulated as an innovative, bottom-up, technology-led, alternative to the institutionalised model of news production: The 20th century model was for news to be gathered and delivered by institutions, very much shaped by the technologies available to them. The 21st century model shaped by new technologies is for news to be gathered and delivered by individuals and small specialist organisations and networks. (Carnegie UK Trust 2014, 2)", "The 20th century model was for news to be gathered and delivered by institutions, very much shaped by the technologies available to them. The 21st century model shaped by new technologies is for news to be gathered and delivered by individuals and small specialist organisations and networks. (Carnegie UK Trust 2014, 2)", "Given that the sector has now attracted public innovation and enterprise investment in the UK through Nesta and the Technology Strategy Board's \u201cDestination Local\u201d initiative (to support \u201csustainable forms of hyperlocal media services\u201d; Geels 2013), it is timely that research focuses on whether hyperlocal publishing can fulfil its potential as a site of enterprise. This article examines some of the realities of running hyperlocal news media services and seeks to understand the range of motivations that fuel its practitioners\u2019 continued involvement in the space. Our focus is on the UK but the issues discussed here mirror the concerns of researchers in the United States and Europe who are investigating similar networks of community news operations. This article seeks to ask: what discourses\u2014\u201cinstitutionalised and taken-for-granted ways of thinking\u201d (Jones 2014, 241)\u2014of entrepreneurship do hyperlocal publishers draw upon? In what ways do they situate themselves as civic activists, digital business innovators or, indeed, both, at the forefront of a journalism enterprise revolution?", "The research discussed here is part of a wider examination of the role of hyperlocal media in the UK. The \u201cMedia, Community and the Creative Citizen\u201d project (funded by the UK Research Councils from 2012 to 2015) focused on the ways in which everyday creativity, supported by digital technologies, could enhance civic life. One of the project's research strands examined the growing phenomena of hyperlocal media in which citizens created news blogs about villages, towns or suburbs, usually about the areas in which they lived. As well as scoping the scene in general by defining the number of active sites and the volume of news it produced (Harte 2013, 2014), the project also undertook a content analysis and survey of practitioners (Williams, Harte, and Turner 2014; Williams et al. 2014).", "The content analysis set out to examine hyperlocal against a similar set of criteria as had been applied to content analyses of the mainstream press. That is: Who gets to define hyperlocal news? What news is covered? What is the civic value of hyperlocal news (Williams, Harte, and Turner 2014, 6)? The analysis found that hyperlocal plays a valuable role in holding local power to account, but the results of a subsequent survey of 183 hyperlocal publishers revealed that two-thirds were paying all the costs of running their operations themselves (Williams et al. 2014, 28). Of those who did earn some funds, just over one-third were making less than \u00a3100 a month (30).", "Such statistics give a glimpse into the precarious financial underpinning of hyperlocal in the UK, offering similar findings to van Kerkhoven and Bakker's (2014, 307) study of the \u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d facing Dutch hyperlocals. But further interviews would reveal the lived experience of running news operations with such seemingly slim resources. It is these interviews that form the focus of this paper in order to discover what range of attitudes to entrepreneurship emerge within a practice so often situated as primarily a civic endeavour but one that is playing an increasingly important role in local media spheres. Specifically, we focus on the range of motivations of practitioners, the extent to which they draw on an entrepreneurial discourse in describing their practice, and explore the degree to which there is self-exploitation and precariousness within the sector."]}, {"title": "The \u201cFictive\u201d Journalism Entrepreneur", "paragraphs": ["Jones and Spicer (2009, 10) have argued that the term \u201centrepreneur\u201d has moved beyond the narrow Schumpeterian notion of the individual \u201cself-made\u201d person profiting from disrupting the market. It is now applied in a much broader sense to a larger range of individuals who might display entrepreneurial behaviours in different contexts. Entrepreneurs might be socially rather than economically focused or perhaps be from within the public sector, identifying efficiencies or improving relationships with citizens. Jones and Spicer argue that this generalisation in the use of the term is symptomatic of the way in which an enterprise culture reached into many aspects of public life in the 1980s and 1990s. Irrespective of setting, there has emerged a clear, dominant discourse of entrepreneurship: \u201c[it] is a relatively coherent discourse which emphasises risk taking, calculation and economising, and represents these points in unfailing positive ways\u201d (Jones and Spicer 2009, 15).", "Researchers have increasingly focused on discourse as a route to explaining how such notions gain consensus. Sally Jones\u2019 (2014, 241) analysis of educational policy papers found that the \u201ccombative, status driven and all-conquering entrepreneur is still prevalent in contemporary business culture\u201d and one that is situated in \u201chistorically masculine-framed ideas of entrepreneurship\u201d (241). Jones argues that in education there exists the idealised \u201cfictive\u201d entrepreneur (drawing on Bourdieu and Passeron's [1994] discussion of the fictive student). Such a figure\u2014gifted, responsive\u2014is framed within policy discussion as a role model to which \u201conly the handful of gifted, fictive students are able to achieve\u201d (Jones 2014, 240). Luke Goode (2009) argues that this situating of such idealised \u201cfictive\u201d figures is common in writings on citizen- or community-led journalism initiatives, noting how much work on citizen journalism tends to \u201cinvoke a modernist, heroic narrative in which individual citizens \u2009\u2026\u2009 serve as fitting descendants of the radical pioneers of modern journalism prior to its corruption by commerce and vested interests\u201d (Goode 2009, 1290). Despite alluding to the political economy of citizen journalism (1289), Goode does not engage with the notion of the citizen journalist as entrepreneur, yet it is clear that the \u201cheroic\u201d fictive figure of the citizen as journalist also permeates the grey policy literature of hyperlocal where, empowered by digital technology and social media, such a figure is required to hold a diverse skill set, well beyond that of the traditional local \u201chack\u201d: You also need to invest time in developing relationships, promoting your site, and in some cases working to turn your operation into a viable business. As the platforms become easier to use and more commonplace, human skills are becoming as important as technical ones. Community management, sales ability and other skills in communication and content promotion are all becoming increasingly important if you want your voice to be heard. (Radcliffe 2012, 16)", "You also need to invest time in developing relationships, promoting your site, and in some cases working to turn your operation into a viable business. As the platforms become easier to use and more commonplace, human skills are becoming as important as technical ones. Community management, sales ability and other skills in communication and content promotion are all becoming increasingly important if you want your voice to be heard. (Radcliffe 2012, 16)", "Radcliffe (2012, 16; writing on behalf of the UK innovation charity Nesta) argues that embracing this diversity of skills, \u201ccan be fundamental in making hyperlocal pay\u201d. But the pressure placed on the hyperlocal entrepreneur by policy-makers and academics alike is not just a personal one but a societal one. The UK communications regulator Ofcom (2012, 103) claimed that these sites have \u201cthe potential to support and broaden the range of local media content available to citizens and consumers at a time when traditional local media providers continue to find themselves under financial pressure\u201d. Martin Moore\u2014writing for the Media Standards Trust\u2014argues that securing the future of local journalism is at stake: \u201cthe business model that supported news in the twentieth century no longer sustains it in the 21st. Hardest to fund has been local news reporting. This is not peculiar to the UK but symptomatic of many mature western democracies\u201d (Moore 2014, 27).", "The question of who will develop and run these sites is partly answered by the Carnegie Trust. They have given financial support to a small number of hyperlocal publishers and argue that hyperlocal offers an entrepreneurial exit strategy for those journalists made redundant from mainstream journalism. It recommends that the National Union of Journalists \u201cshould consider how it can work with employers and the government to support its members who lose their jobs in a news institution to become entrepreneurs running hyperlocal media\u201d (Carnegie UK Trust 2014, 16).1 Pekkala and Cook (2012, 114) draw on a set of interviews with journalism entrepreneurs participating in a development programme to claim that, \u201cJournalists are looking to reinvent their careers\u201d. Further, the \u201creconfigured\u201d journalist entrepreneur has a real chance to act \u201cas a connector: between audiences, services and revenue streams. This triangulation requires a new emphasis on business skills to complement those already honed through journalism\u201d (114)."]}, {"title": "The Precarious Journalism Entrepreneur", "paragraphs": ["Embarking on an entrepreneurial career is inevitably precarious. Mirjam Gollmitzer's (2014, 8) study of the working lives of German freelance journalists found stress and satisfaction in equal measure within the independent context in which they carried out their profession. There was a strong desire to do justice to the normative values of journalism even if it required a degree of self-exploitation: \u201cthe complex narratives of freedom, independence, and public service ethos illustrate the will to journalistic professionalism, even as the acute awareness of economic insecurity and high stress levels relativizes those claims\u201d (12). Gollmitzer's study contributes to the growing literature about the experiences of workers in the creative industries, which have focused on the issue of precariousness (Hesmondhalgh and Baker 2011, 2008; Ross 2008). Gill and Pratt (2008) describe the two ways in which we can understand the term: firstly, \u201cprecariousness (in relation to work) refers to all forms of insecure, contingent, flexible work\u2014from illegalized, casualized and temporary employment, to homeworking, piecework and freelancing\u201d (3); however, they also note how the term \u201cembodies a critique of contemporary capitalism in tandem with an optimistic sense of the potential for change\u201d (10). Those working in a \u201cprecarious\u201d way have the potential to see \u201cnew subjectivities, new socialities and new kinds of politics\u201d (10).", "Hesmondhalgh and Baker's (2008) workplace ethnography of the television industry attempted to show \u201cthe specific ways in which precariousness is registered and negotiated in the lives of young workers in one media industry\u201d (Hesmondhalgh and Baker 2008, 104). Their findings identify the vulnerability of working in the creative sector yet they also draw attention to the \u201csymbolic nature of cultural products\u201d (Hesmondhalgh and Baker 2008, 114) produced by workers. Like the television programmes they discuss, local journalism also has a \u201csymbolic power\u201d that comes with pressures and bears a certain weight of responsibility in terms of enacting the normative values that are inherent within it.", "In looking across research into the motivations of journalism students, Baines and Kennedy (2010, 105) note that students are less motivated by the normative, public service ideals of journalism than they are by the promise of a career that shares the attractive features perceived to be common to other jobs in the creative and cultural sector: \u201cindependence; risk-taking; non-routine; autonomy; creativity; control (and in some cases the prospects of high earnings)\u201d. These features, they argue, are also ones that are dominant in discourses of entrepreneurship. They specifically cite the opportunity that running hyperlocal media operations offers for the enterprising journalism student: \u201cthe establishment of such an enterprise can offer the autonomy, independence and routine-free career sought by many would-be journalists and which is often no longer found in traditional hierarchical corporate media organisations\u201d (98).", "Traditional approaches to enterprise education need rethinking and instead an emphasis on experimentation and creativity can better prepare the graduate to deal with the reality of a career that might never experience secure, full-time employment in the mainstream news industry. It is better train journalists \u201cnot only to work as journalists (employed or freelance), but to establish independent enterprises\u201d (Baines and Kennedy 2010, 98). Thus hyperlocal is situated as an ideal that not only deals with issues of precarity and scarcity of employment opportunities but is also a vehicle through which the socially conscious entrepreneur can \u201cextend the plurality and diversity of journalism\u2014and journalists\u2014serving society\u201d (109). Whilst running hyperlocal websites have now become a useful feature of undergraduate and postgraduate journalism training (in the UK at least), it is unclear how many emphasise the need for entrepreneurial skills alongside journalistic experience."]}, {"title": "Commercial Failures", "paragraphs": ["The continued emphasis on the enterprise opportunities for the individual offered in the hyperlocal space is perhaps surprising given the landscape is seemingly littered with commercial failures. The Guardian\u2019s city-based \u201cGuardian Local\u201d experiment closed in 2011 after just over a year of running hyperlocal operations in three UK cities, claiming that it was \u201cnot sustainable in its present form\u201d (Pickard 2011). Perhaps the largest experiment run in the UK was the \u201cLocal People\u201d network operated by Northcliffe Media (subsequently Local World Ltd) as a franchise operation. A network of paid community publishers curated content and wrote stories in small towns across the UK. However, it gradually removed financial support with around 100 publisher roles reduced to 75 in a restructuring process in August 2012 and in turn the remaining posts were axed the following year.2 Research by Thurman, Pascal, and Bradshaw (2011, 7) examining this network found that although \u201cLocal People\u201d did have paid journalists (before ultimately moving to a franchise model), it suffered in comparison to sites with a more civic-minded approach: the reliance on community publishers from journalism backgrounds suggests that particular assumptions were made about the needs of such a community-driven project. In particular, the idea of community management as a skill distinct from traditional publishing roles appears to be, if not completely absent, then not a priority.

David Baines (2012, 163) offers a case study of a major UK regional (unnamed) news publisher setting up a hyperlocal project but one that ultimately founders as a result of meeting the \u201cMedia Company's corporate needs, not the community's\u201d. Jones and Salter (2012, 103\u2013107) also note the tensions between the need for hyperlocal sites to have an emphasis on community engagement whilst ensuring they attract advertisers that may well compromise that position. The problem of the sustainability of emergent hyperlocal media organisations is the focus of research by Kurpius, Metzgar, and Rowley (2010), who interviewed proprietors of a range of hyperlocals in the United States. They noted that whilst the form had a better chance for survival than previous experiments in civically orientated, participatory journalism, it found itself lacking a single recipe for financial success. They note that although a vibrant alternative media scene was needed now more than ever, they were unsure if hyperlocal media would survive to be part of it: It is not enough to declare hyperlocal media operations the antidote to the decline of traditional media outlets in the United States. None of the evidence suggests that any of these projects has developed a working model that can be easily replicated in other communities and maintained for the long term.

The Comedia group (Comedia 1984; Landry et al. 1985), in discussing the failure of a large number of 1970s and early 1980s alternative press titles, lambasted the sector for its lack of attentiveness to audiences and the resultant lack of appeal of their publications to advertisers: the \u201calternative\u201d press has neither generated enough turnover from within its ranks to support itself nor consistently produced materials that are sufficiently attractive to entice floating buyers from outside its own ghetto, which could make the sector economically viable. (Comedia 1984, 100)", "the \u201calternative\u201d press has neither generated enough turnover from within its ranks to support itself nor consistently produced materials that are sufficiently attractive to entice floating buyers from outside its own ghetto, which could make the sector economically viable. (Comedia 1984, 100)", "The upshot of the failure of the alternative press is that the workers in these small, radical organisations would \u201cexploit their own labour to a high degree\u201d (Landry et al. 1985, 97). Furthermore, in doing so, these organisations played an unintended role in shaping mainstream media output: The \u201calternatives\u201d have produced something which has the chance of commercial viability, the \u201cmajors\u201d move in and \u201csign up\u201d the producers, who then leave the sector \u2009\u2026\u2009 the alternative sector continually functions as a kind of unpaid \u201cResearch and Development\u201d for the major commercial companies.

At first glance the risk of marginality for the current wave of hyperlocal-focused alternative media operations seems remote given the scene is relatively profligate in production terms. Harte (2013) has researched the impressive collective publication rate of hyperlocal sites. Moreover, they receive welcome attention from those working to influence policy-makers and potential investors. But given the pressure on individual hyperlocal producers to be entrepreneurs who embody a diverse set of non-journalistic skills, as well as playing their part in ensuring media plurality (Barnett and Townend 2014), this requires us now to ask: \u201chow do these \u2018hyperlocalists\u2019 sustain their practice and what kinds of entrepreneurs might they be?\u201d"]}, {"title": "Method", "paragraphs": ["Semi-structured interviews with 34 hyperlocal publishers were conducted in late 2013 and early 2014. The interviewees were drawn from those hyperlocals which, based on an analysis of a database of hyperlocals,3 had demonstrated that they were publishing regularly and had been operating for at least a year. Overall, the sample can be said to be representative in as much as the balance of those working with voluntary or income-generating models, as well as the split between journalists/non-journalists, echoed that of the Williams et al. (2014) survey. The sample is certainly generalisable to the rather modest number of hyperlocals that produce content consistently and over a long (for this sector at least) period of time. In 2014, research found that there were 408 active hyperlocal sites in the UK (Harte 2014).", "The degree of formal journalistic experience varied enormously amongst interviewees, ranging from experienced, formally trained journalists (N = 18) to those with no experience at all. There was no specific desire to target those with more or less training or indeed fill a quota that would comprise equal numbers of each, the gradations between trained/non-trained being too fine, with some having worked as journalists in the mainstream press yet having never received formal training. Others had a public relations background with first degrees that involved elements of journalism theory and practice. Clearly some could be regarded as \u201camateur\u201d but Denis McQuail (2013, 92) sums up the increasing problem of trying to label journalists as either \u201cprofessional\u201d or \u201camateur\u201d, especially in the internet age which is: \u201cencouraging new forms of journalism \u2009\u2026\u2009 rejecting formal organisation and with it any claim to professional status\u201d. McQuail argues that whilst journalism in mainstream organisations has become increasingly professionalised requiring higher-level qualifications, in the alternative realm such requirements do not apply but still \u201ctraditional norms and practices\u201d (94) might be as evident in the latter as in the former.", "The interviews were transcribed and then analysed thematically. On reading through the transcripts, the detailed open coding process allowed for a set of labels to be created based on the issues that arose from the interviews and allowing for the categorisation of attitudes and underlying orthodoxies. In his work on the use of Twitter in the newsroom, Stephen Barnard (2014, 7) uses the process of open, axial and then selective coding to allow a set of \u201cframes\u201d to emerge that \u201crevealed the accordant values and position-takings exhibited by actors\u2019 practice in the field\u201d. Such a process was put to use here as the initial coding labels were drawn together into broader contextualising themes.", "Whilst it would have been valuable to undertake a more ethnographic approach to understanding the value of hyperlocal, such an examination immediately comes up against the issue that there is rarely such a thing as a recognisable newsroom space in this sector. More likely, areas within the home, or a caf\u00e9, or public transport, or indeed anywhere and everywhere, become the places from which news is updated. That journalism is increasingly not produced within institutionalised spaces is something journalism researchers have recognised in recent years. Simon Cottle (2007) argues that the focus on \u201croutine\u201d in many earlier newsroom studies saw journalists as subjects of ideologically driven decision-making rather than having personal agency of their own. The disruption caused by technology should allow the researcher to make \u201ca conceptual shift from \u2018routine\u2019 to \u2018practice\u2019\u201d (Cottle 2007, 10), heralding a \u201csecond wave\u201d of newsroom studies (Cottle 2000). Wahl-Jorgensen (2009) recognises that the \u201cdays of the newsroom as a central ethnographic location may be numbered\u201d (33) and the \u201cnewsroom-centric\u201d nature of journalism research studies has marginalised particular categories of workers: local journalists, freelancers and citizen journalists amongst them (29). We are now in a period where workers are less likely to be tied to specific locations (33). That our interviews with hyperlocal publishers took place remotely (via Skype or telephone), mostly from their homes, therefore seems fitting.", "Of the 34 interviewees, 28 were with men and 6 were with women. In terms of geographical spread, England (N = 24), Wales (N = 7) and Scotland (N = 3) were all represented in the sample.

Yet whatever the initial motivation\u2014civic, hobbyist or commercial\u2014it is clear that on starting a hyperlocal there was a need to then develop a wider spectrum of skills that was not always anticipated. Many saw their operation as requiring them to learn digital skills in order to understand the degree of public engagement with their online sites: I've learnt a tremendous amount of actual backend stuff about blogging and SEO [search engine optimisation], and all those kind of things, which I had no clue about before. (Int-23) I do everything really. So there's selling and then making up adverts because I tend to do artwork for most of the people who advertise and then invoicing and chasing money for that, so that's another side of it.

This limited opportunity for knowledge exchange and it was rare to hear of skills being learned via the practices of others: we've picked stuff up.

The value of having greater connectivity between hyperlocals was less about knowledge exchange and more about their potential appeal to advertisers: I think the concept is good in terms of having it as some kind of national network which would you could essentially pool page views or something like that.

Sometimes the reason for this was ideological: I'm really wary of the linkage of community stuff and money \u2009\u2026\u2009 I just think when money gets involved, it can be really tricky.

If you've got newspapers, they're just about money, that's all they're there for\u201d (Int-2). There was an element of bravado in some responses, with a sense that making money was entirely possible, just not desirable: \u201cIf I was interested in becoming a small business, I could do that, but it doesn't interest me in the slightest\u201d (Int-32). One described the potential of their site making \u201c\u00a350,000\u2013100,000 a year\u201d but they would rather operate it as a community venture: \u201cI feel it's more of a community service than anything else \u2009\u2026\u2009 I sometimes feel I'm just doing it for a labour of love. It's for the readers. So that's the part I like about it\u201d (Int-24).", "Confidence was also an issue. Indeed, some of the same people taking ideological positions also cited confidence issues. Many hyperlocals recognised that they needed funding, usually very modest amounts, to avoid the situation of having to pay for running costs themselves. Yet they simply did not feel able to approach businesses or indeed anyone for funds: \u201cI'm terrible about going and asking people for money, just really don't enjoy it at all\u201d (Int-29). Some waited until businesses approached them rather than seek it out: \u201cif somebody wants to advertise and there's a couple of quid in it, then it happens\u201d (Int-15). Those happy to accept advertising, and able to ask for it, do so within a discourse of community enterprise whereby it is fine to help local traders but less so large corporate organisations: [we were asked] what would you do if Tesco came along and said they wanted to advertise in your paper and we said, we wouldn't do it. And actually I hold the same view. We're about the community, we're about supporting the small businesses.

In fact, for some it was any sense of operating in a commercial space that would be the distraction by making the endeavour much less pleasurable: \u201cthe thought of having the economic pressure of actually having to make a living through it, I think it would just totally take away the enjoyment actually and it becomes a chore\u201d (Int-9). Occasionally the interviewees wanted to discuss what was meant by the term \u201chyperlocal\u201d but only one found it a barrier to income generation: we found that it just took a lot of time to explain what it was we were doing, why we were doing it, how it could benefit the business and why they should do it. So it just wasn't really feasible. (Int-34)", "we found that it just took a lot of time to explain what it was we were doing, why we were doing it, how it could benefit the business and why they should do it. So it just wasn't really feasible. (Int-34)", "Perhaps the most common thread in our findings was hyperlocal producers spent more time than perhaps they wanted to on producing content and running their sites. Even where the hours were modest, the position taken was that it was too much in the light of either slim or no pay: \u201cat least between 14 and 20 hours. It really is an unpaid job\u201d (Int-7). \u201cIt's very rare that I'm not doing something to the paper or the site, finding articles, interacting, or whatever\u201d (Int-28). The process of doing hyperlocal often feels like it takes over completely the lives of its producers, with one claiming that: \u201cit's constant. We talk about [website name], it's like 24/7 pretty much\u201d (Int-2). In this particular case it was keeping up with the social media output that took up most of the time and spilt into private domains: \u201cwe might have a missing person or a missing pet that's touched everyone, and I will check in the middle of the night to see if there's any news\u201d.", "Although there was a recognition of the extent to which they were exploiting themselves, issues of exploitation extended beyond the individual hyperlocal producer and out to its network of contributors. Many described how their operations relied on sometimes quite large networks of volunteers who gave small amounts of time. The value that these volunteers gained was usually expressed in two ways. They were either seen as benefiting by gaining new skills or they were assumed to be benefiting emotionally from the act of contributing: \u201cI think the other volunteers also feel that they're working for the good of the community\u201d (Int-28). Clearly, without volunteers many of the hyperlocals in this study would not be operating in anywhere near the capacity they are, but even amongst those who talked up the value of the volunteerism, there were some concerns about the degree to which volunteers were being exploited.", "There was much angst about the amount paid or not paid to contributors to hyperlocals and some expressed a limit to volunteerism: the number of people who want to blog about the neighbourhood for free, which is basically what I've been doing for quite some time, in a sustained long-term way is very, very small but what I've found is that crowdsourcing bits of content and stitching it together is a way that can bring people in.

I've made a tiny bit of money out of the site \u2009\u2026\u2009 it might mean that if someone was doing some of the techie stuff, I could give them a few quid, because I'm a believer in you work, you should get paid for it.

But there was more formal cross-subsidising happening as well. Some hyperlocals described doing paid journalism-related freelance work as a form of cross-subsidy but others discussed how connected business ventures provided the financial underpinning for their hyperlocal. One hyperlocal cross-subsidised through producing magazines for a trade union whilst another produced a trade journal. Another ran a business \u201cexpo\u201d that they claimed provided all the resources to employ two people to work on their hyperlocal site.", "Despite the lack of desire or confidence to generate income, as detailed above, there was evidence of hyperlocals generating funds in innovative ways that demonstrate an entrepreneurial attitude. In one instance, a hyperlocal site that outwardly seems to be very successful in drawing in advertising was in fact using a bartering system: the adverts on there, most of those adverts you see have all been swapped. I wanted some tyres for my car so a guy from [tyre company] swapped me some tyres. I wanted my lawn doing, I've put one on for a lawncare company who's done my lawn for me.

Some hyperlocals had not even the most basic knowledge of what might happen should they attract income: \u201cbeing paranoid I rang up the Tax Office to find out what the code was for some unique tax\u201d (Int-10). Whilst others were keen to dispose of any excess income through philanthropic means: any profit we make, we put into local good causes \u2009\u2026\u2009 it keeps the money circulating locally, but we don't want to bang the drum too much about it because we don't want to be too sanctimonious, be smug about it.

(Int-7)", "It was no surprise to see take-up of grant initiatives given the attention this sector has from public funders. For some it was a key part of their work, although securing funding was not easy: \u201cthat's another part of my job to try and find grants, and obviously they're harder and harder to come by\u201d (Int-28). In this particular instance the grant income was not directly for doing hyperlocal work but instead was for a related activity that would cross-subsidise the hyperlocal: \u201cI do other work with community groups doing digital media projects\u201d (Int-28). In a similar example, the hyperlocal was happy that the funding was for other related activities rather than hyperlocal, making clear that where cross-subsidy happened it did not go towards paying individuals: \u201cI just think when money gets involved, it can be really tricky \u2009\u2026\u2009 it's more about what people feel they want to do rather than have any money involved\u201d (Int-27). But undoubtedly the income flowing into the sector is seeing an entrepreneurial response with those securing success noting its competitive nature: we were 1 of 10 projects out of 165 to be awarded that funding, and that allowed us to set up the business as a limited company and really it went from being a side project to being our main project.

Those who most closely conformed to \u201chistorically masculine-framed ideas of entrepreneurship\u201d (Jones 2014, 241) were as likely as anyone to articulate that the decline in local mainstream media was a problem for local democracy. However, in their terms the appropriate solution to \u201cfilling the gap\u201d was a commercial one whilst for others the \u201cgap\u201d allowed them to perhaps scratch a particular \u201citch\u201d that they then realised had a wider benefit when their \u201citching\u201d was disseminated via the internet through free-to-use open source blogging platforms or social networking sites. An example perhaps of using what Clay Shirky (2010, 176) has described as their \u201ccognitive surplus\u201d to create wider civic value.", "In rejecting financial motives, the majority of our interviewees tended to draw on a civic discourse whereby they see their work creating other forms of value for the community they write about and engage with. In part they draw upon a kind of idealised \u201ccivic web\u201d discourse (Banaji and Buckingham [2013, 9] offer a useful critique of utopianist positions about the civic potential of the internet), whereby internet technologies offer unproblematic routes to civic participation. Such participation is always expressed in positive terms. As one hyperlocal producer attempts to articulate, there is an underlying aim to achieve something closer to cohesion. Every area I think needs something like that to bring communities together, to bring people together, to share so you know what's about because otherwise you don't know what's actually going on in your area. So I think being able to do that is\u2009\u2026\u2009well, it's all about being a community, isn't it, I guess.

Interviewees almost always expressed how their input was above and beyond what was required. They find aspects of it pleasurable and burdensome in turns, and they have a clear sense of the \u201csymbolic nature\u201d (Hesmondhalgh and Baker 2008, 114) of their journalistic outputs. Indeed, in some examples they have a clear sense of the commercial value of their work and have resisted being exploited by mainstream organisations yet they continue to self-exploit based on their belief in the civic value of what they are doing. In turn they have a tendency to exploit others, again, drawing on a civic discourse to explain themselves.", "But even within this dominant civic discourse there is certainly evidence of a wide range of entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes, not least, as we have noted previously, a belief in the value of hard work. As tense as they are when it comes to talking about money, hyperlocal producers will try just about anything to draw in micro amounts of funding and in many cases they seem to be more than content with these small amounts. In that broad sense of how we have come to understand entrepreneurship (whereby it might be socially as well as economically focused, as discussed in Jones and Spicer 2009, 10), these are a group who fit the template: being self-starters, having a diverse skill set, taking risks and being outcome focused. That such outcomes are usually expressed primarily as being for a wider community benefit, with the desire for personal financial gain rarely foregrounded, should not detract from their value or potential impact. As John Hartley (2009, 162) has argued, such examples of \u201cuser-led innovation\u201d have a role in reshaping and even undermining commercial models of public service journalism. However, the confines of the civic discourse mean that for many, the notion of making money is something of an anathema and potentially limits any prospect of further development of their projects. The repeated references to the motivating factor of what we might regard as hyperlocal's \u201cwarm glow\u201d (\u201cthe big thing I get out of this is the creative aspect of it and the community aspect of it\u201d\u2014Int-29) is to a degree a discursive practice that prevents discussion about the complexity of the challenges facing the sustainability of hyperlocal. In some ways this research paints the hyperlocal producer as a conflicted, self-exploited figure in the entrepreneurial landscape."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["This article has drawn on a range of interviews with hyperlocal media producers to argue that whilst the singular \u201cfictive\u201d hyperlocal entrepreneur, as imagined by commentators and lobbyists, does not quite exist, there is a dominant civic discourse that all our interviews draw upon to contextualise their practice. We can observe a range of attitudes to the economics of hyperlocal: at one end are those who welcome the market opportunity and are seeking to grow their operations into larger businesses; whilst at the other, there are those who have a vociferous resistance to any form of income generation. Yet the research findings offer some comfort for those who make claims about the civic value that hyperlocal creates. Academics or organisations who laud the civic activism evident in the output of many sites can feel confident that sustaining it is not dependent wholly on those hyperlocal sites generating income to survive. Williams et al. (2014) found that 62\u00a0per cent of hyperlocal publishers they surveyed raised no income at all yet 52\u00a0per cent saw no problems with sustaining their activity. Our findings have helpfully revealed that whatever position hyperlocal producers take on the issue of money, they do at least share a common set of entrepreneurial attitudes and skill sets. Almost as an inevitable consequence of their circumstances: they are multi-skilled, enjoy relatively autonomous working conditions, have a high degree of personal agency and are not averse to taking risks. Above all, they generally enjoy their work and feel valued by the communities they represent. The hyperlocal journalist entrepreneur then offers a challenge to those twin notions of the \u201chard-nosed\u201d journalist and the \u201chard-nosed\u201d entrepreneur.", "Yet, in line with findings by Kurpius, Metzgar, and Rowley (2010) and van Kerkhoven and Bakker (2014), there is a sense of precariousness over hyperlocal's viability as either an alternative media scene or in simply \u201cfilling the gap\u201d over the long term. For those looking to invest funding or to bring the practice to the attention of policy-makers, they can take comfort that the sector is home to some small business entrepreneurs seeking to grow media businesses that address concerns over media plurality. Yet such figures are few and far between and the risk in looking only for the \u201cfictive\u201d hyperlocal entrepreneur is that inevitably there will be disappointment and the policy gaze will move elsewhere. As Bourdieu and Passeron (1994, 16) point out: \u201cif he [the \u201cfictive\u201d student] does not live up to being which he ought to be\u2014his \u2018being-for-the-teacher\u2019\u2014the mistakes
