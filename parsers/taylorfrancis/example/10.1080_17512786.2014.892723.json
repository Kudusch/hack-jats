It is possible, though, that disasters\u2014precisely because they are unexpected\u2014at least temporarily dislodge journalistic routines that sideline independent, more critical voices. This study uses Gulf Coast newspaper coverage of the BP oil spill to examine whether there are two discernible stages of crisis reporting, the first marked by the more frequent use of unofficial sources (and thus, a more critical tone to the coverage), followed by a narrowing of those perspectives seen as being legitimate as the official interpretation of the crisis emerges, and journalists index their coverage to match that interpretation.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Following the fiery explosion aboard the BP-leased Deep Water Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers, the blowout preventer, designed to seal the well in such a scenario, failed. For the next 87 days the Macondo well spewed nearly 5 million barrels (200 million gallons) of oil into the Gulf waters (Achenbach 2011; Freudenburg and Gramling 2011; Lehner and Deans 2011; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement 2011). There were devastating economic and environmental consequences for the Gulf Coast, the long-term effects of which are still unknown.", "When disasters occur, people seek out narratives that, as sociologist Lee Clarke wrote, \u201cput characters in their places, [make] sense of the actions, and [let] us walk away feeling safer or more superior\u201d (Clarke 2006, 121). In the wake of a public disaster, such as the 2010 BP oil spill, the news media play an important part in constructing these comforting narratives for their audiences. Thus, it is not surprising that the BP oil spill was the top domestic news story of 2010 (Pew Research Center for the People & the Press 2010). Evaluating journalists' coverage of the disaster then is vital to understanding the available narratives that helped the public make sense of the disaster.", "News media narratives often follow routine patterns (Schudson 2003; Tuchman 1997). For example, the news media rarely cover social problems and conflicts as emblematic of systemic problems\u2014that is, covering the BP oil spill as an outgrowth of the United States' dependence on petroleum. Rather, social problems are typically covered as aberrations involving individual rogue actors (i.e., BP) within the system (Olien, Donohue, and Tichenor 1995).", "It is easy to blame BP for the disaster. After all, it was a series of cost-cutting decisions initiated by the oil giant in order to make up for the drilling project's five-week delay (and $20 million in overruns) that were the immediate causes of the disaster (Achenbach 2011; Freudenburg and Gramling 2011; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement 2011).1", "BP, however, is not alone in wagering safety, environmental sustainability, and sound energy policy to meet the United States' insatiable appetite for oil (Freudenburg and Gramling 2011; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement 2011). At the time of the BP crisis, the United States consumed more than 18 million barrels of oil daily, more than all European Union countries combined, and three times more than China, whose oil consumption ranks second in the world (CIA 2011; U.S. Energy Information Administration 2011). Meanwhile, the politically motivated promise of \u201cenergy independence\u201d motivates increasingly high-stake gambles, including drilling miles below the seafloor, with minimal regard for the consequences (Freudenburg and Gramling 2011). According to long-time industry observers Freudenburg and Gramling, Americans' level of energy consumption and the country's energy policies are contributing factors to the BP disaster, and if the country does not reexamine its energy consumption and policies, similar disasters are likely to occur in the future.", "If the media were to fulfill their surveillance function (Lasswell 1948), one would expect that they would raise the critical questions Freudenburg and Gramling (2011) suggest are necessary. On the other hand, past examinations of the media's routines\u2014specifically their overreliance on official sources and their \u201cindexing\u201d of coverage to reflect the degree of consensus among those official sources (Bennett 1990; Bennett, Lawrence, and Livingston 2006; Entman and Rojecki 1993; Kensicki 2004; Smith 1993; Steele 1995)\u2014would suggest that their coverage of the 2010 BP oil spill would downplay those sources most likely to be critical of US energy consumption and policies.", "Immediately following a disaster, however, there is a period of chaos that challenges the media's established routines. Often, this period of speculative, sometimes inaccurate reporting is seen as being a low point for the news media (Graber 2009). It is also possible, however, that the chaos dislodges the media's routine focus on official sources, and that it is during this period immediately following a disaster, such as the BP oil spill, that independent critical voices have the best chance to gain access to the media and shape the narrative before an official interpretation of the disaster coalesces (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1980).", "Thus, this study examines the use of official and unofficial sources and the tone of the Gulf Coast news media's coverage of the BP disaster. It compares the initial stage of the crisis, prior to an official narrative of the disaster coalescing around President Barack Obama's first official speech concerning the oil spill, to the subsequent stages of the disaster. It examines whether there are discernible stages of the crisis, and whether in the chaos of the initial period of the disaster the news media had a higher probability of quoting unofficial sources, which are more likely to be critical of US energy policies."]}, {"title": "Sources", "paragraphs": ["According to Bennett (1990; Bennett, Lawrence, and Livingston 2006), the news media's interpretation of news events, including crises, \u201cindexes\u201d the degree of consensus among \u201cofficial\u201d sources, government officials specifically. According to the indexing hypothesis, the greater the consensus in officials' interpretations of a crisis, the more that consensus opinion is reflected in news coverage.", "There are several complementary, interwoven explanations for journalists' reliance on officials' interpretations of news events (Bennett 1990): that journalists have a symbiotic relationship with official sources\u2014these sources' public relations staffs make it economical for journalists to gather the news, and the journalists help officials broadcast their perspectives; that journalists derive professional legitimization from their access to official sources, which they use to bolster their claims that their reporting represents an \u201cobjective\u201d truth (Steele 1995); and that journalists are fulfilling a social control function, which protects the status quo (Beniger 1986; Janowitz 1991; Lasswell 1948; Olien, Donohue, and Tichenor 1995; Park 1961; Sapir 1961). The latter is especially pronounced in the wake of a crisis/disaster, when the public wants to see that officials are in charge, coping with the disaster, and that everything will return to normal (Clarke 2006).", "Sources are of interest because they play a prominent role in shaping the media's coverage of a given issue (MacKendrick 2010). By relying on officials' interpretations of news events, the media delineate which perspectives are deemed legitimate, and which are not, narrowing acceptable interpretations of news events. In this way, the news media's reliance on official sources amplifies the existing power structure, further marginalizing those individuals and perspectives that fall outside the \u201cofficial\u201d circle (Brown et al. 1987; Freedman, Fico, and Durisin 2010; Steele 1995; Zeldes, Fico, and Diddi 2007). Yet those outside this official circle are precisely those individuals who are most likely to raise the type of critical questions that Freudenburg and Gramling (2011) argue should be asked in the aftermath of a disaster like the BP oil spill.", "Castell\u00f3 (2010), for example, examined the Spanish press' coverage of chemical manufacturers, which simultaneously support the local economy and contribute to environmental and health problems (similar to offshore oil drilling in the Gulf Coast). Castell\u00f3 examined the relative use of frames that focused on the industry's positive impacts (e.g., economic benefits) versus those focusing on the industry's negative impacts (e.g., environmental contamination). The latter were much more common in coverage, which can be explained by the fact that corporate representatives and government officials collectively constituted 80 percent of journalists' sources.", "While Castell\u00f3's (2010) study focused on the Spanish press, very similar patterns have been identified in environmental news coverage in the United States. Kensicki (2004), for example, studied the extent to which coverage in the Los Angeles Times and New York Times focused on the underlying causes and consequences of three social issues, including environmental pollution. Kensicki found that while a majority of the stories about environmental pollution from the two papers mentioned the cause of the pollution\u2014industry most frequently being framed as the culprit\u2014the majority of stories failed to mention any effects of the pollution. Additionally, the government, not industry, was most frequently portrayed as being the party responsible for addressing the problem.", "Kensicki's (2004) study hints at why the media end up holding government, not industry, more responsible for addressing environmental problems. More than three-quarters of the newspaper articles Kensicki studied failed to mention the word \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d or mention a local or national environmental advocacy organization. Yet, as Kensicki suggested, environmentalists and environmental advocacy organizations are the groups most likely to raise critical questions about the effects of environmental pollution, and hold the source of the problem\u2014industry\u2014fully accountable for ameliorating it.", "Entman and Rojecki (1993), for example, studied national media coverage of the nuclear freeze movement, a grassroots effort to force US nuclear disarmament. Representatives of the movement were quoted in only 12 percent of the stories about the nuclear freeze movement; government officials were quoted in 88 percent of the stories. This marginalization of the protesters is significant because Entman and Rojecki's data showed that two-thirds of articles expressing concern over nuclear weapons attributed that concern to non-elite actors. Fewer than a third of the articles quoting elite sources\u2014including government officials and expert sources\u2014expressed concern over nuclear weapons.", "This is a vivid illustration of the fact that those sources the media rely on most heavily are least likely to raise critical questions about potential environmental problems. Entman and Rojecki (1993, 155) concluded that the media's \u201cfreezing out\u201d of the nuclear protesters illustrates the media's system-maintenance function, reducing \u201cthe pressure elites feel to act favorably on the proposal, providing political cover for a symbolic rather than concrete government response.\u201d", "In regard to the media's coverage of previous oil spills, Molotch and Lester's (1975) study of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, also caused by a blowout on an offshore oil rig, found that while more than 84 percent of national newspaper coverage quoted oil company officials, only 15 percent quoted environmentalists. Only 6.8 percent of the national coverage focused on the environmentalists' activities, while 93.2 percent of the coverage focused on the oil company's and federal officials' responses to the crisis. Conservationists did, however, fare much better in local Santa Barbara coverage\u2014it was split evenly between oil company officials and environmentalists\u2014though the authors suggest the latter is primarily a function of Santa Barbara's anti-oil-drilling politics, rather than a distinction of local versus non-local coverage. Nonetheless, even locally, environmentalists received less prominent front-page coverage compared to oil industry officials.", "Smith's (1993) study of newspaper journalists' use of sources in coverage of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill found similar results: government and oil industry officials made up 60 percent of sources quoted in newspaper coverage (scientists, who ranked third, made up only 8.3 percent; environmentalists ranked fourth at 7.8 percent). Furthermore, government and oil industry sources were the most likely to say that the crisis had been overblown and rate Exxon's response to the crisis favorably. This study helps illustrate, as the indexing hypothesis suggests (Bennett 1990; Bennett, Lawrence, and Livingston 2006), that those who have the most access to the media\u2014government and industry officials\u2014have the power to frame the news coverage in a manner favorable to their interests.", "What Molotch and Lester (1975) and Smith (1993) did not examine, however, is how patterns in sourcing change over the course of a crisis, and whether those changes reflect distinct stages on crisis reporting."]}, {"title": "Stages of Crisis Coverage", "paragraphs": ["Bennett's (1990; Bennett, Lawrence, and Livingston 2006) work on the indexing hypothesis primarily focused on the \u201celite\u201d media (e.g., the New York Times) that could reasonably be aware of the official pulse on a given issue at any given point in time. He also focused on official scandals, rather than crises over which officials have less control. Non-elite media, particularly in a time of crisis, are less likely to have a pulse on official interpretations. Rather, they are likely to index their coverage to the official interpretation over time, in part based on the \u201cGolden Rolodex.\u201d That is, the more an official or group of officials is relied upon to give an interpretation of an event, including in the elite media, the more other media are likely to rely on that source to provide a similar interpretation.", "Bennett (1990; Bennett, Lawrence, and Livingston 2006) suggested there are periods in which there is more or less official consensus. But there are also times, especially during crises, during which the media, the non-elite media especially, are likely not aware of officials' interpretations, and thus cannot \u201cindex\u201d their coverage accordingly. And even if the media are aware of officials' interpretations, crises can also dislodge those media routines that under normal conditions cause journalists to rely on official sources. Being a crisis, which by definition is an unexpected event, the 2010 BP oil spill may have, at least temporarily, dislodged journalists' \u201cindexing\u201d routines.", "Graber (2009) suggested there are three discernible stages of crisis coverage: Stage One, just before and immediately after a crisis has occurred, when chaos abounds and journalists scramble to collect the facts and authoritative analysis; Stage Two, when the dominant interpretation begins to emerge, the media attempt to correct any previous errors in their reporting, and they put the crisis into perspective; and Stage Three, during which the media put the crisis into even longer-term perspective and attempt to help the audience cope with the crisis aftermath.", "Graber (2009), who based her three-stage model of crisis reporting more on anecdotal observation than on empirical evidence, views the chaos in the first stage as a weakness of media coverage. She portrays the media as reporting inaccurate information and rumors, in part because the media are desperate for sources in this chaotic phase, and in a break with their routine practice, often end up relying on what she calls \u201cnon-authoritative\u201d sources.", "This first stage, however, before authorities begin to converge on a common interpretation of the crisis, may represent a positive opportunity for some groups that are typically marginalized in routine coverage to have their concerns heard. Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1980) suggest three phases of conflict, the second two of which roughly correspond to Graber's (2009) stages of media coverage. (Tichenor and his colleagues' first stage of crisis reporting occurs out of public view.) In the public phase (the second phase), which corresponds most closely with Graber's first stage of disaster coverage, the conflict moves beyond basic definition. Diverse groups within the community recognize a problem and give it their own interpretations. According to Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien, it is during this stage that the conflict is most open to diverse, potentially competing interpretations.", "Thus, while Graber (2009) saw this period of uncertainty negatively, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1980) framed it more positively as a time of open democratic debate. That journalists rely on sources traditionally seen as less \u201cauthoritative\u201d may indicate media coverage during this stage accommodates more non-government, non-establishment perspectives that are part of an open (and sometimes messy) democratic debate.", "Graber's (2009) second and third stages, however, cover what Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1980, 112) term the \u201clegitimization\u201d phase, when \u201cincumbents label the issue, or some aspect of it, as worthy in terms of basic norms and values of the community.\u201d Thus, while it is difficult to pinpoint where one stage ends and the next begins, it is expected that following the Deep Water Horizon explosion, there will be an initial period of coverage marked by inclusion of more independent sources and critical frames, before the relative proportion of these frames drops off markedly, in correspondence to a single event, or perhaps a series of \u201clegitimizing\u201d events, that narrow what is accepted as a legitimate interpretation of the crisis."]}, {"title": "Hypotheses", "paragraphs": ["Professional journalism tends to follow certain standardized patterns from one newsroom to the next (Schudson 2003; Tuchman 1997). Among these patterns, journalists \u201cindex\u201d their coverage to match the interpretations of official and expert sources, downplaying independent sources (Bennett 1990; Bennett, Lawrence, and Livingston 2006; Brown et al., 1987; Freedman, Fico, and Durisin 2010; Steele 1995; Zeldes, Fico, and Diddi 2007).

Thus, this study proposes the following hypotheses: H1: Journalists will rely more heavily on official than unofficial sources.H2: Stories that quote unofficial sources will be more critical in their tone.

Valid email addresses for 682 accounts were extracted from the bottom of the stories and newspapers' websites. From those email accounts, 220 journalists responded to a survey. These journalists had written 1829 stories about the oil spill, 1000 of which were randomly sampled and coded.", "Coders recorded whether different \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cunofficial\u201d sources were used in newspaper coverage of the BP oil spill.

While this study is not an agenda-setting study, this portion of the coding protocol is closely related to second-level agenda-setting: the idea that the media indicate not only what to think about (first-level agenda-setting), but how people should view those events covered in the news (Hester and Gibson 2003; Kiousis 2004; Sheafer 2007).

Thus, \u201cgood bad news\u201d occurs when the market contracts, but media coverage focuses on the fact that the markets did not contract as much as expected, or that despite the contraction the market still outperformed analysts' expectations.", "Applying this same \u201cgood bad news\u201d concept to analyzing the evaluative tone of media framing of the BP oil spill, positive frames are those that emphasize desirable outcomes. Desirable outcomes include BP making progress on capping the well, the fact that the ecological effects of the oil spill were not as bad as they could have been, etc. Negative frames\u2014those that are more likely to raise critical questions\u2014are those that emphasize negative outcomes: setbacks for BP's efforts to cap the well, ecological impacts of the oil spill on Louisiana's fragile wetlands, etc. Neutral frames either did not mention either positive or negative outcomes, or mentioned both positive and negative outcomes in the same story.", "The author conducted the coding.

To answer this question, first it is necessary to divide the coverage into two periods. There is no theoretical guidance on which to base such a division, but one would expect that President Obama's Oval Office address to the nation\u2014the first in his presidency\u2014on the BP oil spill would be significant in giving shape to the emerging official interpretation of the crisis. Thus, the events of the BP oil spill were divided into two periods, prior to the June 15, 2010, speech, and afterward. Then chi-square tests were used to test whether the frequency of stories citing at least one unofficial source and stories focusing on negative events differed significantly before and after this speech.", "As shown in Table 2, a significantly greater proportion of stories (44.8 percent, N = 91) mentioned at least one unofficial character prior to President Obama's Oval Office address than afterward (37.0 percent, N = 295) (\u03c72(1, N = 1000) = 4.168, p = 0.041).

A change in tone may also be caused by the progress BP made in capping the well after June 15, 2010, and the fact that as the crisis dragged on, it became clearer that the early worst-case fears about the oil spill's impacts would never materialize. However, it should be noted that, as shown in Table 3, while there were significant differences in the proportion of negative stories before and after President Obama's speech, there were not corresponding significant shifts in the proportions of positive (\u03c72(1, N = 1000) = 3.640, p = 0.056) or neutral stories (\u03c72(1, N = 1000) = 3.43, p = 0.064) before and after June 15, 2010."]}, {"title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["As Freudenburg and Gramling (2011, 8) wrote, the BP oil disaster is \u201ca challenge to take a closer, more clear-eyed look at our [energy] policies \u2026 to respond to the oil-darkened waters with clearer thinking.\u201d However, given the dearth of unofficial, independent voices in journalists' coverage and the lack of more critical coverage, to the extent there were \u201clessons to be learned\u201d from the BP oil spill they were not likely to be found in the Gulf Coast journalists' coverage examined in this study.", "A plurality of journalists' coverage (49.9 percent, N = 499) of the BP oil spill did focus on negative, critical news.

The lack of more negative coverage could reflect a concerted effort by the journalists in this study to strive for balance in their coverage, even when the objective facts of the story should dictate more critical coverage.

Prior to President Obama's June 15, 2010, Oval Office address on the BP oil spill crisis, stories were slightly more likely to mention unofficial characters and to report negative news related to the oil spill. There was no theoretical guidance, however, as to which date to use to split coverage of the crisis into two periods (the Oval Office address was chosen from a timeline of events, simply because they represented the first major official comments on the oil spill and the government's response).", "The shift in tone before and after the speech may also be attributed to the fact that news related to the oil spill did objectively improve in the weeks and months following President Obama's Oval Office address. Nonetheless, these empirical findings suggest, while not dismissing any shortcomings in factual reporting that occur following crises, that these events may have a positive effect in terms of partially dislodging media routines and permitting, at least temporarily, a more inclusive discussion of society's problems.", "These findings suggest that it may be more strategic for independent individuals and groups, who are more likely to raise critical questions about systemic problems, to speak up during the initial phase of a crisis when they have a greater likelihood of being quoted in the mainstream news media. However, what this study did not examine is whether the fact that the media quote more critical voices during this initial phase of the crisis has a long-term impact on the narratives the media use. For example, if the media quote more environmental activists in the initial stage of the crisis, does that focus more attention on environmental impacts of the disaster and force officials to address these concerns in later stages of the crisis? Or alternatively, are these alternative voices dismissed along with the speculative and inaccurate reporting that often characterizes the initial stage of disaster coverage?", "This current study provided support for the notion that there are distinct phases of crisis coverage, and that during the initial phase more unofficial, critical voices are quoted in the media. Future research, however, should examine whether these patterns are observed in coverage of other crises, and what impact the greater plurality of voices represented in this initial phase has on media narratives during subsequent stages of a crisis."]}], "references": [{"title": "Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States", "year": "1990", "journal": "Journal of Communication", "volume": "40", "authors": [{"name": "Bennett Lance", "first_name": "Bennett", "last_name": "Lance"}]}, {"title": "None Dare Call It Torture: Indexing and the Limits of Press Independence in the Abu Ghraib Scandal", "year": "2006", "journal": "Journal of Communication", "volume": "56", "authors": [{"name": "Bennett Lance", "first_name": "Bennett", "last_name": "Lance"}, {"name": "Lawrence Regina G.", "first_name": "Lawrence", "last_name": "G."}, {"name": "Livingston Steven", "first_name": "Livingston", "last_name": "Steven"}]}, {"title": "Invisible Power: Newspaper News Sources and the Limits of Diversity", "year": "1987", "journal": "Journalism Quarterly", "volume": "64", "authors": [{"name": "Brown Jane D.", "first_name": "Brown", "last_name": "D."}, {"name": "Bybee Carl R.", "first_name": "Bybee", "last_name": "R."}, {"name": "Weardon Stanley T.", "first_name": "Weardon", "last_name": "T."}, {"name": "Straughan Dulce M.", "first_name": "Straughan", "last_name": "M."}]}, {"title": "Framing News on Risk Industries: Local Journalism and Conditioning Factors", "year": "2010", "journal": "Journalism", "volume": "11", "authors": [{"name": "Castell\u00f3 Enric", "first_name": "Castell\u00f3", "last_name": "Enric"}]}, {"title": "Freezing out the Public: Elite and Media Framing of the U.S. Anti-Nuclear Movement", "year": "1993", "journal": "Political Communication", "volume": "10", "authors": [{"name": "Entman Robert M.", "first_name": "Entman", "last_name": "M."}, {"name": "Rojecki Andrew", "first_name": "Rojecki", "last_name": "Andrew"}]}, {"title": "Gender Diversity Absent in Expert Sources for Elections", "year": "2010", "journal": "Newspaper Research Journal", "volume": "31", "authors": [{"name": "Freedman Eric", "first_name": "Freedman", "last_name": "Eric"}, {"name": "Fico Frederick", "first_name": "Fico", "last_name": "Frederick"}, {"name": "Durisin Megan", "first_name": "Durisin", "last_name": "Megan"}]}, {"title": "Answering the Call for a Standard Reliability Measure for Coding Data", "year": "2007", "journal": "Communication Methods and Measures", "volume": "1", "authors": [{"name": "Hayes Andrew F.", "first_name": "Hayes", "last_name": "F."}, {"name": "Krippendorff Klaus", "first_name": "Krippendorff", "last_name": "Klaus"}]}, {"title": "The Economy and Second-Level Agenda Setting: A Time-Series Analysis of Economic News and Public Opinion about the Economy", "year": "2003", "journal": "Journalism \\& Mass Communication Quarterly", "volume": "80", "authors": [{"name": "Hester Joe Bob", "first_name": "Hester", "last_name": "Bob"}, {"name": "Gibson Rhonda", "first_name": "Gibson", "last_name": "Rhonda"}]}, {"title": "No Cure for What Ails Us: The Media-Constructed Disconnect Between Societal Problems and Possible Solutions", "year": "2004", "journal": "Journalism \\& Mass Communication Quarterly", "volume": "81", "authors": [{"name": "Kensicki Linda J.", "first_name": "Kensicki", "last_name": "J."}]}, {"title": "Explicating Media Salience: A Factor Analysis of New York Times Issue Coverage during the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election", "year": "2004", "journal": "Journal of Communication", "volume": "54", "authors": [{"name": "Kiousis Spiro", "first_name": "Kiousis", "last_name": "Spiro"}]}, {"title": "Media Framing of Body Burdens: Precautionary Consumption and the Individualization of Risk", "year": "2010", "journal": "Sociological Inquiry", "volume": "80", "authors": [{"name": "MacKendrick Norah A.", "first_name": "MacKendrick", "last_name": "A."}]}, {"title": "Accidental News: The Great Oil Spill as Local Occurrence and National Event", "year": "1975", "journal": "American Journal of Sociology", "volume": "81", "authors": [{"name": "Molotch Harvey", "first_name": "Molotch", "last_name": "Harvey"}, {"name": "Lester Marilyn", "first_name": "Lester", "last_name": "Marilyn"}]}, {"title": "Rethinking Validity and Reliability in Content Analysis", "year": "1999", "journal": "Journal of Applied Communication Research", "volume": "27", "authors": [{"name": "Potter W.
