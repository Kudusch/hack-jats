The \u201cpost-factual\u201d is generally seen as a result of the fragmented supply of news, social media information dissemination, and the rise of populism in liberal democracies (McNair 2017). Most prominently, the concept has been applied to the British vote to leave EU in June 2016 and the US presidential election in the same year. Tendencies understood as post-factual coincide with a common criticism of news coverage of terrorists. According to scholarship in the field, media representations of terrorists have a propensity to blur boundaries between news and entertainment, to make emotional appeals, and to celebrify the terrorist (e.g. Kampf and Liebes 2013; Malvern and Koureas 2014; Nacos 2016).", "This article concerns the conditions for covering terrorists set by the so-called post-factual era.

In the following, I focus on representations of terrorists. They are controversial in part because of the great symbolic value that has been attached to these figures of threat and danger, which may nevertheless also turn into objects of fame and idolization (see also Mortensen 2012; Klonk 2017). This has become especially evident in recent years due to the so-called selfie-generation of terrorists (Smith 2016), who have reconfigured the visual culture surrounding terrorism by constructing, producing, and mass-disseminating self-representations. Of course, the definition of \u201cterrorist\u201d is heavily contested and politicized. This article adopts a pragmatic approach by referring to \u201cterrorist\u201d according to the news media\u2019s use of this term in their coverage (e.g. Schaffert 1992; Nacos 2016; UNESCO 2017)", "The objective of this article is to explore the dilemmas attached to media coverage and media self-censorship of terrorists. I first introduce the public on this issue, before developing a theoretical framework concerning challenging aspects of news coverage of the \u201cselfie-generation\u201d of terrorists and media self-censorship. Next, I outline the empirical case study and methodological approach before analyzing the 2016 news coverage of terrorists on the websites of the two Danish public service broadcasters, DR and TV2. I analyze how, despite conflicting public statements for (DR) and against (TV2) self-censorship, a quantitative content analysis demonstrates similar coverage of terrorists by these two media organizations. Finally, the conclusion reflects upon the dilemma of media self-censorship in the post-factual age."]}, {"sec_title": "Media, Terrorism, and the Post-Factual", "sec_content": ["The term post-factual is applied in this article with some hesitation. After all, was there ever a \u201cfactual\u201d era, which has now been replaced? And how is the post-factual different from phenomena discussed 10 and 20 years ago under such labels as \u201cinfotainment\u201d or from postmodern claims about the subjective and relative nature of what is believed to be true and factual? I use this term in accordance with the theme of this special issue seeing as arguments about media self-censorship are closely related to tendencies understood as post-factual. On one hand, as the boundaries between news and entertainment erode, dangerous grey zones between fact and amusement emerge. Self-censorship can, from this perspective, be seen as protecting the public from glorification and promotion of terrorist agendas. On the other hand, media self-censorship risks suppressing reality and undermining the press\u2019 responsibility to inform the public. Media self-censorship may according to this tension be seen either as a solution to the post-factual or regarded as an effect of the post-factual.", "These positions surfaced in a debate on terrorists and censorship in July 2016. Following a year of fatal terror attacks in France, Belgium, and other European countries, French philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy argued for media censorship in an opinion piece published in Le Monde, The Guardian, and other European newspapers. Terrorists should be \u201crelegate[d] to the obscurity of their infamy\u201d, he contended, because by \u201crepublishing their faces, living or (especially) dead \u2013 they become globally recognized characters in the showbusiness side of this terrorist war, thus fulfilling one of their keenest desires\u201d (L\u00e9vy 2016). L\u00e9vy made the case for media self-censorship due to the celebritization of the terrorist and the thin line between fame and infamy (Rojek 2001; Kampf and Liebes 2013). The arguments presented by L\u00e9vy left the debate divided. Opponents emphasized that media self-censorship was problematic in liberal democracies and some even suspected the press of holding ulterior motives for downscaling the coverage of terrorists. For instance, US president Donald Trump suggested that the \u201cvery, very dishonest press\u201d refrained from covering attacks to tone down the threat of terrorists entering Western countries in disguise as refugees (The White House 2017). While these questions concerning media self-censorship and terrorists have been discussed for decades, they have become particularly urgent on account of today\u2019s digital, visual culture surrounding terrorism."]}, {"sec_title": "Covering the Selfie-generation of Terrorists", "sec_content": ["Images are essential to terrorists not only due to the fact that impact of an act of terror depends \u201con its spectacular communication in the press\u201d (Klonk 2017, 133) but also because of the inevitable link between dominant visual representations and the public imagination of the terrorism threat. In particular, ISIS affiliates disseminate images and videos one-to-many and many-to-many via mobile and social media to promote their agenda and offer counter-narratives to those provided by the news media (e.g. Friis 2015; Winter 2015; Zelin 2015; Zhang and Hellmueller 2016; Kraidy 2017). The so-called selfie-generation of terrorists (Smith 2016) or \u201cjihadists chic\u201d and \u201cjihadists cool\u201d (Picart 2015) has created a new culture of terrorist self-representation. By constructing and staging the terrorist\u2019s visual identity, these self-representations further develop the symbolic significance that has been attributed to this figure since the 1960s and 1970s (Mortensen 2012; Klonk 2017).", "Even if digital platforms are vital to terrorist communication, mainstream news media, and television, in particular, remain \u201cthe number one source of information and therefore a major target of terrorist propaganda\u201d (Nacos 2016, 334; see also Mortensen 2015). Terrorists\u2019 self-representations have routinely entered the news coverage in recent years. For example, terrorist selfies appeared in the reporting of several attacks in 2016, including those in Orlando, Brussels, Nice, Berlin, and Istanbul. Terrorists\u2019 visual communication also enters the media as news in itself, for instance, in coverage of videos documenting killings, issuing threats, recruiting followers, etc. The connective media landscape enabling terrorists to produce and convey images has, in the words of Lim (2016, 250), \u201cbrought journalistic ethics and credibility to the forefront of the news media\u2019s contemporary role\u201d. Self-censorship has been placed at the top of the agenda."]}, {"sec_title": "Media Self-censorship of Terrorism", "sec_content": ["Media self-censorship has mostly been studied in transitional or authoritarian countries with de facto, if not always formalized, restrictions on press freedom, such as security risks for journalists speaking out against power (e.g. Gessen 2009; Lee and Chan 2009; Jungblut and Hoxha 2017). In liberal democracies, the news media exercise self-censorship for reasons other than fear of retaliatory measures. This confirms a central insight of \u201cNew Censorship Theory\u201d, which builds upon Foucault, Bourdieu, and others to think beyond the traditional opposition between free speech and censorship (Post 1998; M\u00fcller 2004; Bunn 2015). According to New Censorship Theory, limitations to free speech are not necessarily tantamount to censorship in the sense of an \u201cexternal, coercive, and repressive\u201d practice by \u201cauthoritative social actors\u201d, which are \u201cextrinsic to the communicative process\u201d (Bunn 2015, 29, italics in original). Censorship and self-censorship emerge from within the communicative process and \u201cto study censorship naturally requires situating it within the communicative paradigms of specific historical contexts\u201d (Bunn 2015, 28). The law sets limits for what can be published to avoid proclamations of racism or violations of public decency, privacy, religious beliefs, etc., but the news media are still left with a continuum of choices and must constantly balance conflicting interests in, for example, the coverage of terrorism. Accordingly, as Jungblut and Hoxha (2017, 229) contend, media self-censorship in liberal democracies is essentially a question of media ethics. This is evident in the coverage of terrorists: media self-censorship remains contested, but so does media attention to terrorist actors. Herein lies the dilemma of media self-censorship of terrorism (see also Ubayasiri 2014).", "Challenges related to terrorism coverage have been recognized since the 1960s when terrorist groups began taking advantage of the mass media by adapting their actions and communicative strategies to fit news logics, criteria, and cycles. Conversely, the news media accelerated \u201cthe aggressive trend toward sensationalism in newscasting\u201d and provided \u201can intense spotlight for the high drama of terrorism\u201d (Schaffert 1992, 64). Regardless of this longstanding debate, opinions remain split as to what constitutes \u201cmedia responsibility\u201d in terrorism coverage (Schaffert 1992, 71). Stakes are high, however, as the security of states and citizens is on the line, and the news media must consider how to maintain independence from government agendas (e.g. Kampf and Liebes 2013; Nacos 2016). Coverage is often automatically assumed to promote terrorists, in accordance with the widespread idea that media and terrorists are \u201cstrange bedfellows in a marriage of convenience\u201d (Nacos 2016, 341). As Zelizer (2018, 141) asserts, \u201can uncritical assumption of media influence\u2014the idea that media reach is equivalent to media impact\u2014undergirds much about the war on terror\u201d. There is, moreover, no clear-cut evidence to suggest that ignoring terrorists leads them to escalate violence as a means of reclaiming attention (UNESCO 2017, 13).", "There are several pitfalls to media self-censorship with regard to terrorism. The digitalized and fragmented media landscape renders systematic censorship difficult as information flows above and beyond the mainstream news media (Ubayasiri 2014). Moreover, the ramifications of censorship are unpredictable in liberal democracies, in which coverage of terrorism fulfills various purposes. These include \u201cfurthering democratic dialogue, which [\u2026] may be vital for resolving conflict through negotiations and peace processes\u201d (Ubayasiri 2014, 799) and helping \u201csociety cope with the perceived threat\u201d by following a familiar, highly ritualized script (Nossek 2008, 314). Self-censorship may also serve different objectives. Most importantly, self-censorship can be a means of resisting terrorist media strategies and agenda setting as well as shielding citizens against disproportionate fear of terrorism, bearing in mind the low risk of being the victim of an attack (e.g. Jetter 2017).", "In line with these split opinions, the news media have difficulty navigating a clear and consistent course in their coverage of terrorists. Restrictions have been enforced in various countries on covering and/or photographing terrorists, for example, during hostage taking or court cases (Silver 2012; Nacos 2016; Klonk 2017). Most recently, the news media participated in the July 2016 debate by self-reflecting on their own role and responsibility with regard to publishing images of terrorists. Some opted for self-censorship while others opted against it."]}, {"sec_title": "Coverage and Censorship of Terrorists: Research Design", "sec_content": ["This article takes its empirical starting point in news coverage of terrorists on the websites of Danish public service broadcasters DR and TV2 in the period of January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. These broadcasters were not chosen out of interest in Denmark as a particular national case, but rather because they took opposing positions in the July 2016 debate as to whether the news media should show images of terrorists (TV2) or not (DR). The analysis juxtaposes (1) public statements by DR and TV2 on their coverage of the terrorist with (2) their actual exposure of this figure based on a quantitative content analysis of images included in the coverage. Concerning the first perspective, the analysis draws upon statements by the editors-in-chief of DR and TV2, which appeared in media coverage of the debate and has been retrieved through the Infomedia search engine. The editors-in-chief were unfortunately not available for follow-up interviews. Regarding the second perspective, a quantitative content analysis of web coverage by DR and TV2 was carried out by a research assistant. The initial step was to identify 849 relevant stories on the websites DR.dk and nyheder.tv2.dk by using the search term \u201cterrorist\u201d in Infomedia. Next, the research assistant coded for simple categories, such as number of images, genres, actors, gender, and geographical/national contexts. Generating a rich trove of data, this content analysis serves as an empirical basis for two studies (see Mortensen 2018).", "An intercoder reliability test was conducted by the author of this article as the second coder, recoding 85 units (10 per cent) of the sample. Units coded in the test were chosen randomly by using the online service random.org. By applying ReCal, an online intercoder reliability Web service (Freelon 2010), intercoder reliability was calculated for five different variables (number of images; ID photography; CCTV footage; selfies and similar; \u201cprivate\u201d snapshots). These variables all measured above 0.8 using Krippendorff\u2019s (2004) alpha, the lowest being 0.81 and the highest 1 (see also Mortensen 2018)."]}, {"sec_title": "The Self-censorship Dilemma: The Practitioner\u2019s Perspective", "sec_content": ["Discussions concerning self-censorship in terror coverage in July 2016 had a direct impact on the news media\u2019s guidelines and practices. In this manner, the news media assumed the triple role of reporting on the debate, taking a stand in the debate, and adjusting their coverage as a result of the debate. After L\u00e9vy opened this discussion, the debate quickly migrated to other countries in which news organizations needed to determine whether they should follow suit with their French colleagues and implement self-censorship. The media organizations analyzed in this article operate under public service contracts. DR is financed solely by license fee, while TV2 is partially subsidized by license fee and partially commercially run. Both public service contracts specify that terrorism must not be furthered in any way.1 However, public statements by leading figures from DR and TV2 suggest disagreement as to what this actually means.", "From a practitioner\u2019s perspective, the editors-in-chief of DR and TV2 repeated many of the arguments presented in the research literature. They both addressed the question of whether to cover or censor representations of terrorists as a \u201cdilemma\u201d. Ulrik Haagerup (DR) said: It is a dilemma that every time we cover terrorism, we play the terrorists\u2019 game. Because media coverage is essential to terrorists. So we have to tread carefully and not enter into a breaking blood frenzy and broadcast just for the sake of broadcasting. (Bruun-Hansen 2016, italics in original)Haagerup also explained that DR had decided not to show images of terrorist perpetrators because \u201cit might inspire other lunatics\u201d who had been unsuccessful in life and could be susceptible to recruitment if told that they could \u201cwork for a greater cause and make something of themselves if they commit these misdeeds\u201d (in Barlag 2016). Elsewhere, Haagerup specified that even \u201ca portrait photograph\u201d could lead \u201cweak souls\u201d to see terror as the road to fame (in Bennike 2016).", "It is a dilemma that every time we cover terrorism, we play the terrorists\u2019 game.

We are very conscious of the dilemma that press coverage of terrorism might feed terrorism. But the alternative is worse, because then we have given in to the terrorists. (J\u00f8rgensen 2016)He also stated that it was \u201cdifficult to know for sure whether media coverage of terrorism inspires terrorism\u201d and therefore \u201cthe media should not inflict censorship on themselves, because then you are halfway down this slide already\u201d (in J\u00f8rgensen 2016).

To contextualize the analysis, I first present some general characteristics of the coverage. Of the 849 articles published on DR and TV2 in 2016, 19 percent or 160 articles included visual representations of terrorists. These 160 articles included a total of 462 representations of terrorists. The content analysis indicates that terrorists are given most exposure in connection with attacks: 58 percent or 456 articles were published in connection with attacks (the numbers for DR and TV2 show little variation). This implies that terrorists are at least partially successful in setting the agenda. Genres for representing terrorists are discussed in depth elsewhere (Mortensen 2018). For now, I introduce a few general traits. TV2 overall shows more images produced by terrorists themselves, coded as \u201cselfies and similar\u201d and \u201cprivate photos\u201d (Figure 1), while DR tends to publish more images supplied by the authorities, i.e. \u201cID photography\u201d and \u201cCCTV footage\u201d (Figure 2). Also related to the content of the images, the gender division is unambiguous, as 98 percent of the images were coded as \u201cmale\u201d (Figures 3 and 4).

From January 1 to July 31, DR showed 200 images of terrorists, an average of 28.7 images per month. TV2 published 222 images of terrorists in this period, an average of 31.7 a month. This indicates TV2\u2019s slightly greater inclination to publish images of terrorists, although this varies from month to month, with two in February and 111 in March. DR had the least images in July, with four (this might indicate that DR was already showing reluctance after the major terror attack in Nice), while March was its peak month with 82 images. In the period following the debate, August 1 to December 31, numbers declined drastically for both broadcasters. DR published 14 images during these 5 months, or an average 2.8 images per month. TV2 published 22 images, an average of 4.4. Although other contributing factors cannot be ruled out, it seems likely that this decrease was at least partially a consequence of the debate. For example, the reduction cannot readily be explained by a similar decline in the number of major attacks, as Berlin, Istanbul, and other places were hit during this period.", "We are faced with the paradox that, despite their public statements, both broadcasters show distinctly fewer images of terrorists after the debate. TV2 deviated most from the course communicated in public as the numbers indicate a hesitance to show images of terrorists. This is especially interesting given that TV2\u2019s editor-in-chief highlighted that it was doubtful that media exposure promoted terrorism. DR differed to a lesser extent by showing images of terrorists in spite of its declared reluctance, for instance, eight in August, in the immediate wake of the debate.", "How might this discrepancy be explained? Even if the empirical material offers no definitive answers, there are three interesting aspects to discuss. First, the different public service models of the two broadcasters might play a role in their public communications. It is worth noting that DR (solely license funded) spoke in favor of protecting the public, while TV2 (partially license funded) focused more on providing media users the service of up-to-date news, 24/7, with as few filters as possible.", "Second, the broadcasters saying one thing and doing another might indicate a difference between editorial frontstage reflections and backstage practices. Statements on the self-censorship dilemma constitute part of the editors-in-chief\u2019s frontstage performances. The broadcasters not only position themselves in this debate to explain their coverage but also to take part in the opinion-formatting function of the press and to voice a general opinion on news media (self-)censorship and their societal roles, obligations, and responsibilities. This involvement in public debate on media ethics constitutes a way for \u201ckey members of journalism\u2019s interpretive communities to assert their authority, negotiate normative boundaries, and gain legitimacy\u201d (Mortensen, Allan, and Peters 2017, 72).", "Third, the issue of media self-censorship is tied to strong principles and key values in liberal democracies. The fact that the coverage, especially in the case of TV2, deviated from declared policies might suggest that day-to-day editorial decisions regarding terrorist coverage require more nuanced reflection over self-censorship than is indicated by the clear-cut statements made in the public debate. Even though both editors-in-chief stated that the coverage of terrorists was a dilemma, more finely calibrated deliberations were not communicated. Principled statements seemed to be accompanied by ad hoc editorial decisions."]}, {"sec_title": "Conclusion: Post-factuality and the Self-censorship Dilemma", "sec_content": ["A pessimistic conclusion to the analysis would be to regard the discrepancy between what the broadcasters say and do as an effect of the post-factual in itself. Opinions uttered in public by the editors-in-chief seem to some extent detached from actual practice. However, it should also be kept in mind that, like other catchwords, the \u201cpost-factual\u201d tends to block nuances. When applied to, for instance, coverage of terrorists, the risk is impending of repeating the superficiality and simplification that the concept is meant to critique.", "Tendencies coined under the term \u201cpost-factual\u201d play a complicating role in the dilemma of media self-censorship. Media attention to terrorists and their acts can rarely pass as \u201cjust\u201d information but will always be contested as it might play into terrorists\u2019 hands: Ulrik Haagerup from DR criticized the sensationalistic aspects of press coverage of terrorism, to which he applied the phrase \u201cbreaking blood frenzy\u201d. Meanwhile, Jacob Nybroe from TV2 reflected upon the dangers of suppressing information because this means the media have \u201cgiven in to terrorists\u201d. However, the window for media self-reflexivity seemed to open and close rather abruptly. This debate \u2013 as is often the case \u2013 surfaced in the wake of brutal attacks but has not been continued or followed up on in Denmark since, for instance, in order to evaluate whether the decisions for and against censorship were correct or whether the stated policies were actually carried out in practice. Challenges related to covering terrorism have been recognized for half a century.
