However, circulation data are often reported out of context, resulting in misinterpretations of reader preference and misinformed strategy. To accurately assess demand for print newspapers, this study examines the price of 25 widely-circulated U.S. newspapers in 2008, 2012, and 2016. The analysis documented industry-wide, more-than-substantial price hikes. Seven-day home delivery price more than doubled, and weekday single-copy price tripled. Seven-day subscription now costs $510 a year \u2013 print subscribers are paying on average $293 more to have the same newspaper delivered to their doorstep. Despite the increase in price, about two-thirds of print readers remained loyal to a product that has become much more expensive and is considered dying by many. Further analysis on price elasticity of demand indicates that demand for the print product remains inelastic, which explains why so many newspapers implemented price hikes to increase circulation revenue. Nevertheless, the constantly increasing price raises concerns about the sustainability of newspapers\u2019 pricing strategy in the longer term. These concerns and managerial implications are discussed.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Twenty years into the news industry\u2019s digital transformation, conventional newspapers remain an important, if not the most important, source of information about the workings of government, industry, and the major institutions that shape our lives, still playing a key role in providing accountability journalism (Shafer 2016). In addition, despite a multitude of digital offerings, the print edition remains the most read newspaper product and the primary revenue driver for the vast majority of newspapers (Barthel 2016; Benton 2018; Chyi and Tenenboim 2017; Pew Research Center 2015; Thurman 2018).", "While the legacy format is important, \u201cthe death of print\u201d is one of the most prominent themes in U.S. newspapers\u2019 self-evaluation (Chyi, Lewis, and Zheng 2012; Edge 2014; Meyer 2009; Picard 2009a). This theme \u2013 or death narrative \u2013 has gone viral since the 2008 recession. In 2009, Time magazine published the list of \u201cTen Most Endangered Newspapers in America\u201d (McIntyre 2009). In 2010, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., Publisher of The New York Times, said: \u201cWe will stop printing The New York Times sometime in the future, date TBD\u201d (Fallon 2011, para. 1). The Center for the Digital Future at the University of Southern California (2011) predicted that almost all U.S. print newspapers would disappear in five years \u2013 i.e., by 2016.", "This death narrative fostered a sense of crisis and cast serious doubts on the sustainability of print newspapers. A 2012 survey reported that as many as one-third of U.S. newspaper publishers envisioned a time when they would stop publishing the print edition (Jenner 2012). The pessimistic view about print has also influenced the industry\u2019s digital transformation strategy (Chyi 2015; Thurman et al. 2019), contributed to the \u201canti-print, pro-digital\u201d discourse (WAN-IFRA 2017), and most importantly resulted in the continued disinvestments in the print operation (ASNE 2016; Carson 2014; Grieco 2018). Since the recession, U.S. newspaper newsroom employment dropped by 45% (Grieco 2018). Tens of thousands of journalists, mostly those on the print side, lost their jobs. This resulted in a lesser product and the \u201csuicide spiral\u201d \u2013 newspapers may actually kill their core product through cutbacks (Rosenstiel and Mitchell 2004). Therefore, \u201cprint is dying\u201d is more than a narrative. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy (Chyi 2015), it has real, profound consequences in shaping the fate of newspapers and the future of journalism.", "Tracing its origin, the death narrative is often triggered by the decline in print circulation (e.g., Center for the Digital Future 2011; Crichton 1993). During the 2008 recession, long-term circulation declines accelerated. Year-to-year weekday circulation fell by 7.1% in the six-month period ended March 2009, 10.6% by September 2009, and 8.7% by March 2010 (Table 1). Charging More and Wondering Why Readership Declined?

The problem is that such downward trends are rarely reported in the context of soaring newspaper price. Even the widely read State of the News Media Reports make no reference to changes in price and their plausible impact on circulation (Barthel 2016; Pew Research Center 2015, 2017). In the most recent report (Pew Research Center 2017), circulation declines were once again covered without any reference to the industry-wide price hikes: The estimated total U.S. daily newspaper circulation (print and digital combined) in 2016 was 35 million for weekday and 38 million for Sunday, both of which fell 8% over the previous year.

As a result, circulation data could be easily and mistakenly interpreted as evidence suggesting that print readers are either losing interest in the \u201cdead-tree\u201d product or dying off, while in the real world the price of print newspapers has been soaring since 2008. For example, The Dallas Morning News raised its monthly print subscription rate from $21 to $30 \u2013 a 43% increase \u2013 in May 2009 (Bailly 2009).", "As many newspapers are facing existential challenges, too much is at risk if circulation data as a proxy of consumer demand are not interpreted correctly. To assess demand for print newspapers in the appropriate economic context, this study examines changes in the price of print newspapers since the recession and compares them against changes in readership within the same time frame. Through a longitudinal analysis of 25 major U.S. newspapers\u2019 price and readership data in 2008, 2012, and 2016, the results shed new light on news consumers\u2019 demand for the \u201cdead-tree\u201d edition and help prevent further misinterpretations of circulation data."]}, {"title": "The State of the U.S. Newspaper Industry", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. newspaper market is characterized by a unique structure: Among the 1,338 dailies (Editor & Publisher 2016), the vast majority are local papers operating in narrowly defined geographic markets as local monopolies, facing no direct competition because most U.S. cities are served by only one newspaper (Lacy and Simon 1993; Rodgers et al. 2004). These newspapers used to be \u201cwildly profitable\u201d (Edmonds, Guskin, and Rosenstiel 2011), enjoying profit margins as high as 25%\u201335% in the 1990s (Picard 2008) and controlling market shares \u201cenvied by marketers of other products\u201d (Picard and Brody 1997, 43).", "Newspaper circulation peaked in 1987 at 62.8 million copies (weekday) and 1993 at 62.6 million (Sunday) and started to decline slowly (State of the News Media 2018) as a result of ever increasing media choices. Despite these declines, print newspapers kept their \u201cmass media\u201d status before the 2008 recession hit. The pre-recession level of U.S. newspaper circulation was 50.7 million (weekday) and 51.2 million (Sunday) (State of the News Media 2018).", "In the mid-1990s, major newspapers started exploring digital production and delivery on the Web. In 1999, more than 2,600 U.S. newspapers, including non-dailies, were providing online services (Editor & Publisher Interactive 1999). Almost all newspapers gave content away online for free \u2013 thus generating little digital circulation revenue.", "The industry as a whole remained financially robust, generating an unprecedented amount of income in the years before the recession: Circulation revenue peaked in 2003 at $11.2 billion, and advertising revenue, the primary revenue source, also reached an all-time-high in 2005 at $49.4 billion (State of the News Media 2018), of which only 2 billion came from digital advertising (2015).", "In sum, before the recession, the print edition was newspapers\u2019 core product, generating almost all advertising and circulation revenue and contributing to the industry\u2019s high profitability. Digital revenue was negligible in most cases.", "When the economic downturn occurred in 2008, the U.S. newspaper industry was enjoying the historically high level of advertising revenue. So the losses in advertising revenue appeared to be nothing but dramatic \u2013 from $42.2 billion in 2007 to $34.7 billion in 2008, and to $24.8 billion in 2009 (Pew Research Center 2015). As stated above, advertising has been the primary revenue source for most U.S. newspapers, which accounted for as much as 70%\u201385% of a typical newspaper\u2019s total income (Picard 2002), so the recession forced newspaper firms to respond to this unexpected financial hardship.", "Most slashed resources for their print product while continuing investing in their digital ventures. In 2008, nearly 16,000 newspaper jobs disappeared. By the end of 2009, nearly 15,000 more newspaper employees lost their jobs (Paper Cuts 2013). Overall, newspaper newsroom employees declined by 45% between 2008 and 2017, from about 71,000 journalists in 2008 to 39,000 in 2017 (Grieco 2018). Other cost-cutting measures include reducing the number of pages or eliminating sections from the paper, seen in cases such as The New York Times (P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a 2008); others, such as Detroit Free Press, The Detroit News, and The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), eliminated home delivery on certain days of the week (Tennant and Chyi 2014).", "Another collective action taken by the industry in response to this revenue \u201ccrisis\u201d was to reduce its long-term reliance on advertising. Given that newspapers\u2019 digital revenue remained elusive, generating more income from print circulation appeared to be a solution.", "The Dallas Morning News was among the first U.S. newspapers implementing a significant price hike for their print product. In 2009 alone, it raised its seven-day home delivery rate from $21 to $30 and then to $33.95 per month. The price of single copies also increased from 75 cents to $1 on weekdays and from $2 to $3 on Sunday (Case 2009). This pricing strategy was not implemented without a theoretical foundation. Based on market research on the price inelasticity of demand among readers, which measures the degree to which consumers respond to price changes, this newspaper ensured that an increase in price would increase circulation revenue (Case 2009). Through a series of price hikes, it effectively reduced its reliance on advertising (print and digital) from 78% in 2007 to 54% in 2011. The share of circulation revenue went up from 18% in 2007 to 39% in 2011 (Tennant 2011). Many newspapers followed suit, but the scope and the scale of such price hikes remain unknown.", "What is known is that U.S. newspapers\u2019 self-coverage during the recession overwhelmingly focused on short-term circulation/readership declines, failed to provide contextual information, and overall did a poor job in using media economics data to present a holistic picture of newspapers\u2019 financial troubles (Chyi, Lewis, and Zheng 2012). What is worse, to this day, industry reports on circulation declines remain problematic \u2013 as stated above, even the State of the News Media reports, published annually by the Pew Research Center, fail to provide any pricing information when reporting circulation trends (Barthel 2016; Pew Research Center 2015, 2017).", "It is therefore crucial to empirically and systematically examine the context in which circulation declines occur. Specifically, this study seeks to track how the price of print newspapers has increased since the recession, addressing the following research questions: RQ1: To what extent has major U.S. newspapers\u2019 print subscription price changed sincethe recession?

A study based on 51 U.S. newspapers\u2019 print readership data collected by Scarborough Research found that seven-day in-market print reach (the percentage of print readers among the local population) declined from 42.4% in 2007 to 35.9% in 2011 and 28.8% in 2015 (Chyi and Tenenboim 2017).", "Despite continued declines, scholarly research conducted during the past 20 years indicates that the print format has remained competitive in relation to the same newspaper\u2019s online counterpart (for a detailed review, see Chyi 2015).

The price elasticity of demand, which is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a product divided by the percentage change in the price of that product, measures how responsive quantity demanded is to a change in price.", "The price elasticity is almost always negative, reflecting the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded. When the absolute value of price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, demand for this product is considered elastic, characterized by high responsiveness to price change. When the absolute value of the price elasticity is smaller than 1, demand is inelastic, characterized by low responsiveness to price change. When the absolute value of the price elasticity is exactly 1, demand is unit elastic, characterized by proportionate responsiveness to price change (Hoskins, McFadyen, and Finn 2004).", "Early studies examined the impact of price on demand for U.S. newspapers and found such demand to be very inelastic \u2013 or insensitive \u2013 to price change (Lewis 1995; Picard and Brody 1997). That is, when the price for a newspaper changed, it was not accompanied by a substantial change in consumer demand for the newspaper. This is because most U.S. newspapers operated as local monopolies and thus could set the price and circulation size with less concern about competition (Picard and Brody 1997). Price elasticity of consumer demand for U.S. newspapers was estimated to be as low as \u22120.2 (Hoskins, McFadyen, and Finn 2004).", "In recent years, the media landscape has changed greatly. A 2012 study by a consulting firm found that price elasticity for some U.S. newspapers ranged from \u22120.3 to \u22121.1, with an average of \u22120.7 (Weber and Poyar 2012). Price elasticity of demand at this level still suggests that raising price would result in a decline in readership (quantity demanded) but an increase in circulation revenue (price\u2009\u00d7\u2009quantity), providing an incentive for newspaper publishers to raise the price of their print product as advertising revenue plunged.", "These price hikes were proposed by business consultants (Weber and Poyar 2012), implemented by newspaper publishers, and hailed by media scholars and critics (Bailly 2009). The primary goal was to reduce newspapers\u2019 reliance on unstable advertising revenue. But the magnitude of industry-wide price hikes and the plausible impact on consumer demand have not received sufficient scholarly attention.", "To fill this gap, this study revisits the price elasticity of demand for print newspapers. Drawing on media economics literature and market research (Hoskins, McFadyen, and Finn 2004; Lewis 1995; Picard and Brody 1997; Weber and Poyar 2012), it proposes the following hypothesis and research question: H1: Demand for major U.S. newspapers\u2019 print product remains inelastic to changes in price.

Its seven-day subscription price increased from $104 in 2008 to $162 in 2012. Thus, percent change in price is (162\u2013104)/[(162\u2009+\u2009104)/2]\u2009=\u200943.6%. So the price elasticity of demand is \u221219.4%/43.6%\u2009=\u2009\u2212.44.

In contrast, the Orange County Registrar (7%) and the New Jersey Star-Ledger (8%) are characterized by the lowest print reach.", "In 2008, these newspapers\u2019 average print reach was 37% (S.D.\u2009=\u2009.16, n\u2009=\u200920), ranging from 5%4 to 60%. By 2012, the average print reach dropped to 31% (S.D.\u2009=\u2009.14, n\u2009=\u200921), ranging from 5%5 to 50%. By 2016, the average print reach is 26% (S.D.\u2009=\u2009.09, n\u2009=\u200920), ranging from 7% to 41%. Overall, these newspapers (n\u2009=\u200918) have lost 14% of the adult population in their respective market since 2008.", "Ratio analysis revealed that these newspapers\u2019 2016 print reach is on average 65% of what it was in 2008. Looking into individual papers\u2019 print reach, some have experienced more declines than others. The Austin American-Statesman\u2019s current print reach is 54% of what it was back in 2008. The Denver Post and The Dallas Morning News have also seen above-average degree of decline \u2013 their current print reach is 57% of what it was in 2008. On the other side of the spectrum, the Tampa Bay Times has maintained a very stable print reach \u2013 it is 95% of what it was in 2008 \u2013 showing little decline.", "All the results for RQ1-3 were summarized using arithmetic means. Table 2 also presents the median \u2013 the middle value of the data \u2013 which is less susceptible to statistical outliers.", "H1 proposed that demand for major U.S. newspapers\u2019 print product remains inelastic to changes in price. To calculate each newspaper\u2019s price elasticity, percentage change in print reach was divided by percentage change in seven-day home-delivery price using the mid-point formula. Table 4 presents the results. Overall, among the 25 newspapers, in most cases \u2013 15 in Period 1 (2008\u20132012) and 16 in Period 2 (2012\u20132016) \u2013 the absolute value of price elasticity of demand is smaller than 1, suggesting that demand for these newspapers\u2019 print product is inelastic. As a result, a price hike would cause further declines in readership but generate more subscription revenue. H1 was largely supported. Charging More and Wondering Why Readership Declined? A Longitudinal Study of U.S. Newspapers\u2019 Price Hikes, 2008\u20132016All authorsHsiang Iris Chyi & Ori Tenenboimhttps://doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2019.1568903Published online:18 January 2019Table 4. Price elasticity of demand.CSVDisplay Table", "RQ4 asked to which extent price elasticity of demand for these newspapers\u2019 print product has changed since the recession. In Period 1 (2008\u20132012), price elasticity ranged from \u22122.39 (The Orange County Register) to 0 (The New York Times)6; the average was \u2212.76. In Period 2 (2012\u20132016), price elasticity ranged from \u22126.57 (The Dallas Morning News) to 1.76 (U-T San Diego)7; the average was \u221265.", "List-wise comparison of the 18 newspapers with data at all three time points indicated that the average price elasticity changed slightly from \u2212.80 to \u2212.70 from Period 1 to Period 2."]}, {"title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["This study examined the extent to which major U.S. newspapers\u2019 print subscription price and single-copy price changed since the 2008 recession. The analysis documented industry-wide, more-than-substantial price hikes. Seven-day home delivery price more than doubled, and weekday single-copy price tripled. In-market print reach declined across the board, but about two-thirds of print readers remained loyal to a product that has become so much more expensive. This study also updated research on U.S. newspapers\u2019 price elasticity of demand. In most cases, demand for the print product has remained inelastic, which explains why so many newspapers implemented price hikes after the recession.", "These findings carry important implications regarding the economics of newspapers along the following dimensions:", "This study revealed the degree to which major U.S. newspapers\u2019 print price has increased since the recession. Price has been soaring. Weekday single-copy price tripled. Seven-day subscription now costs $510 a year \u2013 print subscribers are paying on average $293 more to have the same newspaper delivered to their doorstep. Given such dramatic price hikes, declines in print readership should not surprise anyone. As the Law of Demand (or common sense) suggests, higher price drives consumers away. In other words, while newspapers have suffered from a shrinking reader base, at least part of the decline was self-inflicted.", "Given the magnitude of these price hikes, the fact that news outlets and trade publications often covered circulation declines without providing any pricing information is problematic. Omitting that information, such reports not only failed to present the whole picture but likely also contributed to the \u201cdeath narrative\u201d through mischaracterizing readers\u2019 demand for print newspapers. At a time when the newspaper industry is facing existential challenges, this is alarming because misinterpretations of readership data may lead to misunderstandings of reader preference and result in misinformed strategies hurting the industry. This seems to be a recurring issue, however, as scholars have long questioned the quality of U.S. newspapers\u2019 self-coverage (Carey 1974; Picard 2009b).", "As mentioned earlier, raising the print price was the industry\u2019s collective response to the recession when its digital operations generated little revenue. To this day, most U.S. newspapers\u2019 digital performance has remained underwhelming (Chyi and Tenenboim 2017). In contrast, most newspaper readers who consume a newspaper do so in print. Print-only readers constitute more than 50% of newspaper readership (Barthel 2016), and print readers still outnumber digital readers by a wide margin (Chyi and Tenenboim 2017). However, the stronger-than-expected performance of the print product has received little attention in industry discourse. Furthermore, industry leaders and digital enthusiasts often describe the legacy format as obsolete (like horses, carriages, buggy whips), or dying. Through empirically examining changes in newspaper price, this study uncovered another important aspect of consumer behavior: nearly two-thirds of newspaper readers have stayed loyal to the \u201cdead-tree\u201d edition despite price hikes as dramatic as documented in this study. This provides further evidence for newspaper readers\u2019 stronger-than-expected attachment to the print edition. Demand for the supposedly \u201cdying\u201d product has remained inelastic, which explains why the print edition to this day remains the cash cow, the primary revenue driver, for newspapers across the board (Benton 2018; Chyi and Tenenboim 2017).", "Twenty years into newspapers\u2019 digital experiment, it is crucial that publishers reassess reader preference and refocus on preferred platforms.", "Granted, the rationale behind newspapers\u2019 price hikes was to reduce their reliance on unstable advertising revenue. Given inelastic demand for the print edition, this strategy worked as expected, bringing in additional circulation revenue from loyal print readers. However, while circulation revenue may have increased in the short term, dramatic price hikes like these are not without long-term consequences. First and foremost, while demand for newspapers remains inelastic, it is not nearly as inelastic as it used to be. Literature suggests that price elasticity of newspaper demand used to be as low as \u22120.2 (Hoskins, McFadyen, and Finn 2004). But with price elasticity at the current level (\u22120.7), a 10% increase in price would reduce the number of paying subscribers by 7%, other things being equal. While most newspapers have chosen to take advantage of reader loyalty by raising the price of the print edition repeatedly, a continuously shrinking readership means a less attractive product for advertisers. Since readership is the foundation for advertising, readership declines at least partially contributed to the free fall in print advertising revenue from $42.2 billion in 2007 to $16.4 billion in 2014 (Pew Research Center 2015).8 Was turning away from the advertising model a wise strategy in the long term? Or, was the newspaper industry over-reacting to market fluctuations when the recession hit? Ten years after the recession, these questions are important and should not remain unanswered.", "There are also long-term implications regarding the sustainability of such pricing strategy. While print readers are now charged much more, are they getting a better product compared with eight years ago? With the 45% cutbacks on newsroom employment (Grieco 2018), the answer is clear. On the other hand, the difficulty in monetizing digital content has caused the extensive use of audience metrics and an increasing emphasis on popular topics online (Hanusch 2017; Myllylahti 2017; Tandoc and Thomas 2015). These metrics-driven practices may erode a newspaper\u2019s credibility, an asset that distinguishes newspapers from other media outlets in such a media-rich world. In sum, raising the price of a print newspaper may not always work. Without re-investing in the product, exploiting reader loyalty by raising the price continuously is not a long-term solution.", "This study has weaknesses that should be addressed with further research. First, the analysis focused on U.S. newspapers alone. In addition, only newspapers with a circulation of more than 200,000 were included in the analysis. Although the U.S. is a major newspaper market and this analysis included the most circulated newspapers in that market, future research should examine demand for print newspapers in other markets or include different types of newspapers in the analysis to present a comprehensive picture. Second, price elasticity was calculated at four-year intervals, which also means that the \u201cother things being equal\u201d condition was probably not met (One may argue that \u201cother things\u201d are never equal unless the test takes place in a lab setting). While the researchers have made every effort to clean data and address issues that might have affected the validity of the longitudinal analysis (e.g., mergers), these limitations should be considered when interpreting the results.", "In sum, the findings presented here demonstrated the importance of understanding demand for print newspapers in the appropriate economic context. Since demand for newspapers is determined by consumers, their attachment to a product considered by many as dying carries important implications for the future of journalism."]}], "references": [{"title": "Journalism and Criticism: The Case of an Undeveloped Profession", "year": "1974", "journal": "The Review of Politics", "volume": "36", "authors": [{"name": "Carey James W.", "first_name": "Carey", "last_name": "W."}]}, {"title": "The Political Economy of the Print Media and the Decline of Corporate Investigative Journalism in Australia", "year": "2014", "journal": "Australian Journal of Political Science", "volume": "49", "authors": [{"name": "Carson Andrea.", "first_name": "Carson", "last_name": "Andrea."}]}, {"title": "A Matter of Life and Death?
