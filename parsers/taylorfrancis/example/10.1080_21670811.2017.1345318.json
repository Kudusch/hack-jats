Their use involves both direct interaction with the platforms themselves and, increasingly, the use of specialist third-party apps to find, filter, and follow content and contributors. This article explores some of the ways that social media platforms, and their technological ecosystems, are infusing news work. A range of platforms and apps\u2014including Geofeedia, Spike, and Twitter\u2014were critically examined, and their use by trainee journalists (N = 81) analysed. The results reveal how journalists can\u2014and do\u2014surveil social network users and their content via sophisticated, professional apps that are also utilised by the police and security forces. While journalists recognise the value of such apps in news work, they also have concerns, including about privacy and popularism. Although the participants in this study thought the apps they used could help with verification, there were warning signs that an over-reliance on the technology could develop, dulling journalists\u2019 critical faculties.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["For the majority of journalists in many countries, social media has become an indispensable professional tool, employed on a daily or weekly basis to monitor events, find sources, and verify information. Heravi and Harrower (2016) found that almost 99 per cent of Irish journalists used social media in a professional capacity. In the wider milieu of seven Western European and North American countries, 85 per cent of journalists utilised social media at least weekly to find news sources, with almost as many, 74 per cent, monitoring events via social media in a typical week and 68 per cent using it in processes of verification (Gulyas 2016). Across all seven countries, bar one\u2014Germany\u2014over half of the journalists agreed with the statement: \u201cI would not be able to carry out my work without social media\u201d.", "However, journalists face a number of challenges in utilising social networks professionally. Fundamentally, the problem is one of scale. The sheer volume of material being produced has made it impossible, using the social networks\u2019 own interfaces, to monitor and verify all the contributors and content that might match a journalist\u2019s interests. This problem has been known for some time. Schifferes et al. (2014) interviewed journalists in 2012 and found they were dissatisfied with the search and filtering functions offered by social networks, calling them \u201cvery hit and miss\u201d.", "The breadth of social networks\u2019 reach, the frequency with which they are used, and the quantity and character of information uploaded by users have made them a unique resource, with the data they carry of interest not only to journalists but to a wide range of other users. Social networks realised quickly that they could not, on their own, meet the myriad demands users had for the content they carried, so they started to provide access to their data\u2014mostly via APIs (application programming interfaces)\u2014enabling third parties to build software applications (or \u201capps\u201d) that offered a multitude of services. This process transformed the social media network or site involved into a platform on top of which \u201cnew forms of value\u201d could be built (Diakopoulos 2017, 178).", "Twitter turned itself into a social media platform relatively early, just months after its launch (Stone 2006), and five years later, in 2011, more than a million third-party apps were registered (Twitter 2011). Facebook opened up its data to external developers a little later, earning platform status in 2007. By 2015 its founder was reporting that more than 30 million third-party apps had been created (Novet 2015).", "Journalists found that the so-called \u201cecosystem\u201d of apps being built on top of social media platforms contained some tools that were particularly useful. One popular app was TweetDeck, which allows journalists and others to find, filter, and interact with contributors and content on Twitter in ways not supported by the platform\u2019s own apps.1 A 2013 survey of Irish journalists found 23 per cent to be using TweetDeck (Heravi, Harrower, and Boran 2014).", "Despite the relatively high levels of adoption of such tools, much of the academic research into journalists\u2019 use of social media makes no distinction between the social networks themselves and the apps that are, often, the interface between those journalists and people and posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook (see, e.g., Artwick 2013; Broersma and Graham 2013; Gulyas 2016; Heravi and Harrower 2016; Hermida, Lewis, and Zamith 2014; Larsen 2016; Van Leuven, Deprez, and Raeymaeckers 2014; Santana and Hopp 2016; Skogerb\u00f8 et al. 2016; Vis 2013; Wallsten 2015).", "Social media management and monitoring apps have, however, been covered by journalism\u2019s trade press (see, e.g., Edge 2015; Silverman 2014). When such apps are mentioned in the journalism studies literature, though, it is usually in passing (see, e.g., Johnston 2016). An exception is the study of 24 European journalists by Brandtzaeg et al. (2016), in which the computational tools used to help verify social media are enumerated, and the context of their use examined.", "This article argues that it is important to better understand the capabilities of such apps, how they are employed, and the possible consequences on journalistic routines and output. This is particularly the case since the apps have grown in sophistication, with some now offering their users the ability to surveil citizens anytime, anywhere, and others employing algorithms that scan social networks and make judgements, autonomously, on which events have news value.", "This article explores some of these advanced social media monitoring apps, examining their technical capabilities; exposing them, in an experimental setting, to a sample (N = 81) of trainee journalists to see how they might be adopted; and analysing what the consequences of any such adoption could be."]}, {"title": "Selection of Apps", "paragraphs": ["As has already been mentioned, millions of apps have been built on the platforms that social networks have established. Although most apps are unlikely to be of professional interest to journalists, scores of them are. For example, Joanna Geary, Twitter\u2019s \u201cHead of Curation\u201d, has published a list of 34 \u201cuseful 3rd-party Twitter tools for journalists\u201d (Geary 2014); and in \u201cThe Social Media Reporter\u201d, Cordelia Hebblethwaite (2016) recommends over 30 apps journalists can use to detect trends on social networks, and search, verify, and locate content and contributors. Hebblethwaite picks out an app called Banjo for particular praise, calling it an \u201cincredibly powerful tool for finding geolocated social media from a specific location\u201d. Banjo\u2019s founder, Damien Patton, has claimed that his company is \u201cbuilding the world\u2019s first crystal ball\u201d (YouTube 2016).", "The wide variety of apps used by journalists meant that this study had to be selective about which to include in its analysis and experiment, and it was decided that any more than four would place too large a cognitive burden on the experiment\u2019s participants. The apps chosen do not make up a representative sample of those used by journalists; rather, the selection was made with the purpose of reflecting two developments of growing importance in the ecosystem of apps relevant to news work:1. Apps that allow location-based monitoring of social networking activity, with the plotting of geo-tagged posts on a map a common feature.2. Apps that incorporate elements of artificial intelligence or algorithms in order to detect automatically events or stories that are trending.", "Apps that allow location-based monitoring of social networking activity, with the plotting of geo-tagged posts on a map a common feature.", "Apps that incorporate elements of artificial intelligence or algorithms in order to detect automatically events or stories that are trending.", "Location is vital to much reporting, with many newsworthy events, such as natural disasters and demonstrations, inextricably linked to specific geographical locations. Social media networks themselves have not, historically, provided, within their own apps or interfaces, functionality to allow journalists or others to find posts from, or locate posts to, particular locations accurately.2 This has limited their utility as a means by which journalists can search for and verify potentially newsworthy information. The ability to conduct location-based social media monitoring and research is also of interest in other industries, for example marketing, corporate security (see, e.g., Lecher and Brandom 2016), and public safety (see, e.g., Wieczner 2016).", "The addition of artificial intelligence or algorithms to third-party social media apps in order to detect automatically events or stories that are trending is a second important development. Although social media networks have, for some time, included lists of trending topics, these have little utility to journalists. For example, Twitter\u2019s \u201cTrends\u201d list is limited to 10 topics and offers no useful control to the professional user. Again, the ability to be alerted to relevant trends via automated analyses of social networks is something that not just journalists but also those in other industries\u2014e.g. finance (see, e.g., Wieczner 2015)\u2014are interested in.", "The demand for location- and trends-based monitoring of social networks has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of investment being put into the development of a range of apps, a selection of which are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Furthermore, at least one of the social networks\u2014Facebook\u2014has developed its own application (\u201cSignal\u201d), designed specifically to help journalists \u201csurface relevant trends\u201d (Facebook 2015), and even some professional end-users are developing their own. Reuters, for example, has built \u201cTracer\u201d, an in-house system \u201cto detect news events on Twitter and [assess] their veracity\u201d (Liu et al. 2016, 207).", "The three particular apps selected for this study included what were, at the time, two of the market leaders in each category\u2014Spike and Geofeedia\u2014as well as a technologically advanced newcomer\u2014SocialSensor\u2014that had been designed specifically with journalists in mind. Twitter was also included in order to have one social media platform\u2014the most important in terms of news work (see, e.g., Heravi and Harrower 2016; Santana and Hopp 2016)\u2014represented in its unmediated form. Spike and SocialSensor were free to use: Spike via a two-week trial, while access to Geofeedia was negotiated for the duration of the study. At the time this study began, Geofeedia and Spike were used by a range of large news organisations including the BBC, Associated Press, and The Guardian. Journalists using such apps have described them as an important part of their professional routines. The Huffington Post believes Spike is a \u201chuge aid\u201d (Newswhip n.d.-a), and a social news reporter at BuzzFeed said it is a \u201cbig part of my routine\u201d (Newswhip n.d.-b). An employee of the BBC\u2019s user-generated content \u201chub\u201d thought Geofeedia enabled the corporation to find higher-quality user-generated content more quickly (Johnston 2016), while the Vice President of CNN International called it an \u201cearly warning system\u201d (Stone 2014).", "While there is an increasing body of literature on the technical development of such apps (see, e.g., Aiello et al. 2013; Fletcher, Schifferes, and Thurman 2017; Liu et al. 2016), there are scant surveys of their capabilities and how they are used, or discussions about the possible consequences. This study is an attempt to start to fill these gaps, by focusing on\u2014in Lewis and Westlund\u2019s (2016) terms\u2014the \u201ctechnological actants\u201d and the \u201chuman actors\u201d involved; in other words, the apps and some of their intended end users."]}, {"title": "Methodology", "paragraphs": ["A mixture of methods were used to explore the functionality of social media platforms and apps in a journalistic context; their use in the discovery and assessment of news events, stories, and sources; and the professional, ethical, and societal implications of such use. Firstly, a sample of the social media platforms and apps (hereafter referred to as SMPAs) involved was examined using content analysis. Secondly, the uses made of those SMPAs by trainee journalists were investigated via analysis of self-reports produced following a two-week experiment during which the participants used a variety of SMPAs for journalistic activities. This section describes these methods in more detail.", "Here content analysis is used in its contemporary sense to include the examination of the \u201cminutiae of communication \u2026 [including] interfaces\u201d (Krippendorff 2004, xvii), in particular the \u201cenabling and networked properties of communication media\u201d (Thurman 2017). The sampling units were the four SMPAs. Analysis was carried out by the author during September and October 2015. The recording/coding stage of the content analysis was almost inseparable from the process of unitising the units to be recorded/coded. This was a result of the absence of taxonomies and coding rules to describe the functionality of the sampling units being analysed. Although no formal reliability testing was carried out, it is argued that because the aim of the content analysis was to record the existence of functionality, rather than test for more subjective coding categories (such as levels of violence in media content), the process was relatively objective, producing reasonably dependable results.", "A sample of 81 postgraduate journalism students was used to investigate the use made of the SMPAs in news work. The participants were students on the MA in International Journalism at City, University of London. Although they were students at the time of the experiment, it was considered that their experiences and opinions could help explore the character and consequences of the use of SMPAs in a journalistic context for two reasons. Firstly, because the master\u2019s programme on which they were enrolled is highly practical. On the course, students \u201clearn how to gather and report [news] in various styles \u2026 [becoming] adept at print, broadcast and online journalism\u201d, and they are \u201cencouraged to complete [a journalism] internship\u201d (City, University of London 2017). Secondly, because in order to be admitted on to the programme, students are required to have work experience in journalism. The participants had a median age of 23, 80 per cent were female, and they originated from 25 different countries. Three-quarters came from countries in the European Union, with the largest number\u201410\u2014from the United Kingdom.", "The participants received instruction on the journalistic use of Geofeedia, Spike, SocialSensor, and Twitter from two faculty members in the Department of Journalism at City, University London during a three-hour lecture and workshop. They were then asked to spend a period of two weeks using the SMPAs, and write a report of 800 words or more based on their experiences. The participants undertook the task between 28 January and 18 February 2015. In their reports they were instructed to assess the extent to which the SMPAs enabled them to:\u2022 Identify potentially newsworthy events on social networks before they were mentioned in the mainstream media.\u2022 Assess the reliability of social network contributors.\u2022 Identify published stories that were popular on social networks before that popularity became obvious in mainstream media channels.\u2022 Get updates on stories, including multimedia elements and potentially useful sources.\u2022 Identify sentiment around a story.", "Identify potentially newsworthy events on social networks before they were mentioned in the mainstream media.", "Assess the reliability of social network contributors.", "Identify published stories that were popular on social networks before that popularity became obvious in mainstream media channels.", "Get updates on stories, including multimedia elements and potentially useful sources.", "Identify sentiment around a story.", "A total of 81 reports were completed, which were loaded into the NVivo 10 software in order to code and retrieve text, build theories, and conduct data analyses.

Twitter\u2019s user interface has a number of features that are useful to journalists wanting to find, filter, and follow content and contributors on the platform. For example, Twitter allows users to create specific \u201clists\u201d of Twitter accounts. When users view a list, only posts from those account holders on the list are shown. Journalists often create such lists in order to be able to focus on particular topics or locations. Twitter users can also see \u201cTrends\u201d, a Twitter-generated list of approximately 10 keywords, phrases, or hashtags that are trending on Twitter at any given moment, although it is not possible to set trends around narrow geographical areas, only whole countries or large cities. Twitter\u2019s search box and advanced search page allow users to search tweets by hashtag, keyword, or phrase, or filter tweets based on factors including their recency, news value, multimedia content, proximity to the user\u2019s current location, date posted, sentiment, and language (see Table 3).", "The functionality of each of the four SMPAs was analysed using a series of criteria relating to the social media platforms whose content they carry, the filters they offer to allow sorting of both individual social media posts and news stories, and their general functionality. It was found that SocialSensor offered the widest range of functionality across all three categories (see Table 3). Although the differences between Twitter and the three specialist apps were not great in quantitative terms, the qualitative differences were significant. For example, although, like SocialSensor and Geofeedia, Twitter filtered social network posts by location, it only gave vague control (\u201cNear me\u201d) compared with the fuller control of SocialSensor and the much fuller control offered by Geofeedia.5"]}, {"title": "Results: Experiment", "paragraphs": ["As already discussed, the development and use of apps such as Geofeedia, SocialSensor, and Spike has been prompted by the huge volume of content on social networks that journalists and others encounter, and the fact that much of it is irrelevant to their professional interests.

Reasons mentioned included ease of use, the list of Trends, and the ability to create focused \u201clists\u201d. Although some participants thought Twitter lists were useful, others found that they quickly lost their relevance, and some participants found Twitter limited in its ability to provide information on contributors that would allow journalists to assess their credibility.", "The experiment revealed, to some participants, how there can be a mismatch between the news values of the mainstream media and the public, and they saw these SMPAs as a way journalists could more closely align their news agenda with public tastes:Using those four tools, I noticed that this story [the Chapel Hill shootings] massively appeared on social media before there was any mention of it on US mainstream media websites or even TV channels.", "Using those four tools, I noticed that this story [the Chapel Hill shootings] massively appeared on social media before there was any mention of it on US mainstream media websites or even TV channels.", "However, some participants were concerned about the consequences of being influenced by what was popular:I am a bit sceptical about detecting trends through social media, because I believe that what media should be doing is quite the opposite.

It has revealed the capabilities of a sample of apps that are representative of wider trends towards forms of location- and trends-based social media monitoring that incorporate elements of automation. Examination of these tools over time has shown a growing convergence in their functionality, no doubt based on the growing demand from journalists and other clients for a fuller range of functions to help them sort and evaluate the increasing amounts of information on social media platforms. I believe that this convergence will continue, as will attempts by the social networks themselves, in particular Twitter and Facebook, to enter this space, either through acquisitions or through the development of their own apps. For example:\u2022 In October 2015, Twitter started to cluster tweets into stories (via their \u201cMoments\u201d feature), bringing it closer in functionality to Spike and SocialSensor in allowing users to explore clustered stories, not just curated lists of Twitter accounts or a limited number of trending keywords or hashtags.\u2022 Since this study\u2019s substantive content analysis was conducted, Spike has added native Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and Instagram content to its platform. This moves it closer to SocialSensor as a tool that is not just useful for seeing how previously published content is trending, but also allows users to discover native content from social media.\u2022 In September 2015, Facebook launched \u201cSignal\u201d, a service that allows journalists to \u201csurface relevant trends, photos, videos, and posts from Facebook and Instagram for use in their storytelling and reporting\u201d (Facebook 2015).", "In October 2015, Twitter started to cluster tweets into stories (via their \u201cMoments\u201d feature), bringing it closer in functionality to Spike and SocialSensor in allowing users to explore clustered stories, not just curated lists of Twitter accounts or a limited number of trending keywords or hashtags.", "Since this study\u2019s substantive content analysis was conducted, Spike has added native Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and Instagram content to its platform.

Although a small minority of the trainee journalists saw no benefits, the majority found the four social media platforms and apps to be of use, although in different ways. Some were extremely positive, suggesting that such tools \u201cmust\u201d be used to cover some types of news event:Coverage of New York Fashion Week (NYFW) has been entirely transformed by the use of social media. In order to successfully cover such events, journalists must use tools like Twitter and Geofeedia.", "Coverage of New York Fashion Week (NYFW) has been entirely transformed by the use of social media. In order to successfully cover such events, journalists must use tools like Twitter and Geofeedia.", "However, this experiment also confirmed findings from previous research (Thurman et al. 2016) that social networks, even when mediated by specialist apps such as Geofeedia and SocialSensor, are of less use for finding original breaking news than for discovering updates on stories that have already broken, contacts and multimedia relevant to those stories, and trends and sentiment around them.", "Overall, it appears that, at the moment, there is still no one-stop shop for finding news and trends in social media and getting guidance on verification. Participants preferred SocialSensor and Spike over Geofeedia for detecting sentiment and trends, whereas Geofeedia scored highly in its ability to provide updates on stories that had already broken in a known location, and in the processes of verification\u2014in particular allowing journalists to check if social media content had been posted from the claimed location. Despite Twitter\u2019s lack of journalist-focused tools, it was still preferred by some participants, in particular for its ability to detect sentiment around stories, a lesson, perhaps, in the value of familiarity, availability, and simplicity.", "The SMPAs described here are in a state of flux, and even those that had been fully commercialised had limitations, mostly a result of the fundamental challenges inherent in attempts, in close to real time, to collect, process, and filter the hundreds of millions of social media posts broadcast every day. Nevertheless, even at this relatively early stage of development, we see the potential of such tools to change journalistic practice and, ultimately, news output itself.", "As such tools improve and infuse news work further, careful attention will need to be paid to the consequences. The dangers were clear to this study\u2019s participants. Firstly, there is concern over the privacy and ethical implications of being able to monitor individuals, including young people, very closely, with unprecedented speed and at unprecedented scale (for further discussion, see the Postscript). Secondly, there are risks that these tools will drive journalists and editors to give the public more of what is popular on social networks, rather than, in the words of two of the participants, \u201cbeing trendsetters\u201d or \u201cwriting important stories, no matter how unpopular \u2026 they might be\u201d. Indeed, when the participants were surveyed 10 months after the experiment, they were, on average, more worried than not that this would be the case. A third danger, not mentioned by the participants themselves, is misplaced trust in such tools: a failure to question their output. Much as pilots can become over-reliant on cockpit automation, journalists must be wary not to fall into the trap, as a number of our participants did, of thinking material appearing on such tools has been automatically verified. When the participants were surveyed 10 months after the experiment, more than 20 per cent thought that the information found on each of the SMPAs was \u201cautomatically verified\u201d \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d, with another 56 per cent thinking such automatic verification occurred \u201csometimes\u201d. None of the SMPAs attempt to do any automatic verification of the content they publish. However powerful such platforms and apps might be or are likely to become, the capacity for human ingenuity to fool them, and their inability to anticipate every eventuality, mean that journalists will always have to take final responsibility for the veracity of what they publish.", "The SMPAs addressed by this study depend on particular inputs and sets of instructions in order to operate. In the selection of those inputs and the creation of those instructions, the introduction of biases is inevitable. One of our participants identified the Western bias in the inputs SocialSensor used. What was less obvious was SocialSensor\u2019s \u201cbias\u201d towards male, metropolitan, and mainstream media sources (Kunert and Thurman 2017; Thurman et al. 2016). SocialSensor was not unique in having such biases; rather, its biases happened to be in the public domain because of the particular nature of its development. As SMPAs like Geofeedia and Spike become a bigger part of news work, greater levels of transparency are needed in order that journalists and news consumers can be better informed about the operation of these new gatekeepers of the digital media age."]}, {"title": "Postscript", "paragraphs": ["Since the data for this study were collected, the privacy and civil liberties implications of monitoring individuals\u2019 activities on social networks via apps such as those discussed in this article have become topics of some controversy. In October 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union revealed that Geofeedia was being used by over 500 \u201claw enforcement and public safety agencies\u201d, including to monitor \u201cactivists and protesters\u201d (Cagle 2016). Subsequently, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social networks withdrew Geofeedia\u2019s access to their data (Lecher and Brandom 2016). Facebook said it had terminated access because Geofeedia had used Facebook data in \u201cways that were not authorised\u201d (Lecher and Brandom 2016). However, there have been suggestions that Facebook was aware of the capabilities of Geofeedia and was using it as part of its own corporate security operations (Lecher and Brandom 2016). Furthermore, although Twitter also blocked Geofeedia\u2019s data access, Twitter continues to allow its data to be used by other service providers, notably Dataminr, which they part-own (Dent 2016). Dataminr is marketed to journalists for its ability to analyse all tweets in real time to surface story \u201cleads based on topic and areas of coverage\u201d (Dataminr, n.d.). However, it also has a \u201cGeospatial Analysis Application\u201d (Lamb 2016), very similar to that offered by Geofeedia, and has signed contracts to supply its services to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Department of Defense (Brandom 2016; Emptywheel 2016). It appears, therefore, that, as Kalev Leetaru writes:the tech press\u2019 portrayal of Geofeedia as an isolated case of social monitoring gone wrong could not be further from the truth \u2026 The massive data ecosystems provided by the major social media platforms make it impossible for them to prevent this kind of social surveillance (Leetaru 2016).", "the tech press\u2019 portrayal of Geofeedia as an isolated case of social monitoring gone wrong could not be further from the truth \u2026 The massive data ecosystems provided by the major social media platforms make it impossible for them to prevent this kind of social surveillance (Leetaru 2016)."]}, {"title": "DISCLOSURE STATEMENT", "paragraphs": ["No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."]}, {"title": "FUNDING", "paragraphs": ["The research was supported by a research grant from the Volkswagen Foundation."]}], "references": [{"title": "Sensing Trending Topics in Twitter", "year": "2013", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "volume": "15", "authors": [{"name": "Aiello Luca Maria", "first_name": "Aiello", "last_name": "Maria"}, {"name": "Petkos Georgios", "first_name": "Petkos", "last_name": "Georgios"}, {"name": "Martin Carlos", "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "Carlos"}, {"name": "Corney David", "first_name": "Corney", "last_name": "David"}, {"name": "Papadopoulos Symeon", "first_name": "Papadopoulos", "last_name": "Symeon"}, {"name": "Skraba Ryan", "first_name": "Skraba", "last_name": "Ryan"}, {"name": "G\u00f6ker Ayse", "first_name": "G\u00f6ker", "last_name": "Ayse"}, {"name": "Kompatsiaris Ioannis", "first_name": "Kompatsiaris", "last_name": "Ioannis"}, {"name": "Jaimes Alejandro", "first_name": "Jaimes", "last_name": "Alejandro"}]}, {"title": "Reporters on Twitter: Product or Service?", "year": "2013", "journal": "Digital Journalism", "volume": "1", "authors": [{"name": "Artwick Claudette G.", "first_name": "Artwick", "last_name": "G."}]}, {"title": "Emerging Journalistic Verification Practices Concerning Social Media", "year": "2016", "journal": "Journalism Practice", "volume": "10", "authors": [{"name": "Brandtzaeg Petter Bae", "first_name": "Brandtzaeg", "last_name": "Bae"}, {"name": "L\u00fcders Marika", "first_name": "L\u00fcders", "last_name": "Marika"}, {"name": "Spangenberg Jochen", "first_name": "Spangenberg", "last_name": "Jochen"}, {"name": "Rath-Wiggins Linda", "first_name": "Rath-Wiggins", "last_name": "Linda"}, {"name": "F\u00f8lstad Asbj\u00f8rn", "first_name": "F\u00f8lstad", "last_name": "Asbj\u00f8rn"}]}, {"title": "Twitter as a News Source: How Dutch and British Newspapers Used Tweets in their News Coverage, 2007\u20132011", "year": "2013", "journal": "Journalism Practice", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Broersma Marcel", "first_name": "Broersma", "last_name": "Marcel"}, {"name": "Graham Todd", "first_name": "Graham", "last_name": "Todd"}]}, {"title": "Building the \u2018Truthmeter\u2019: Training Algorithms to Help Journalists Assess the Credibility of Social Media Sources", "year": "2017", "journal": "Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Fletcher Richard", "first_name": "Fletcher", "last_name": "Richard"}, {"name": "Schifferes Steve", "first_name": "Schifferes", "last_name": "Steve"}, {"name": "Thurman Neil", "first_name": "Thurman", "last_name": "Neil"}]}, {"title": "Hybridity and Social Media Adoption by Journalists: An International Comparison", "year": "2016", "journal": "Digital Journalism", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Gulyas Agnes", "first_name": "Gulyas", "last_name": "Agnes"}]}, {"title": "Twitter Journalism in Ireland: Sourcing and Trust in the Age of Social Media", "year": "2016", "journal": "Information, Communication \\& Society", "volume": "19", "authors": [{"name": "Heravi Bahareh Rahmanzadeh", "first_name": "Heravi", "last_name": "Rahmanzadeh"}, {"name": "Harrower Natalie", "first_name": "Harrower", "last_name": "Natalie"}]}, {"title": "Sourcing the Arab Spring: A Case Study of Andy Carvin\u2019s Sources During the Tunisian and Egyptian Revolutions", "year": "2014", "journal": "Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication", "volume": "19", "authors": [{"name": "Hermida Alfred", "first_name": "Hermida", "last_name": "Alfred"}, {"name": "Lewis Seth C.", "first_name": "Lewis", "last_name": "C."}, {"name": "Zamith Rodrigo", "first_name": "Zamith", "last_name": "Rodrigo"}]}, {"title": "Social News = Journalism Evolution?
