Theoretically the study is anchored in Habermas's notion of the public sphere, and its recent reconceptualizations in theories of \u201ccultural citizenship\u201d, \u201ccivic agency\u201d and \u201cpublic connection\u201d. The project operationalizes these theories through the concept of users' perceived \u201cworthwhileness\u201d of news media, a user-anchored concept which incorporates the different functionalities of the situational cross-media use of news by citizen/consumers in everyday life. Empirically the article presents the findings of a large-scale survey that traces the imminent challenges facing players in the news market, as a consequence of accelerating divisions between \u201coverview\u201d and \u201cdepth\u201d news media (across print, broadcasting and the Internet). The project is conducted in a partnership of university-based researchers and analysts from one of the major newspaper publishers in Denmark, and presents the first user-based analysis of the relative position of each individual news medium in the entire news media matrix.

The news media are rightly deemed to be crucial for the provision of democratic prerequisites, and the media research community has given a high priority to the exploration of the adequacy of the news media in bringing about these prerequisites.", "Nevertheless, this vast body of research has been characterized by a number of significant omissions\u2014or perhaps one should say rather that some aspects of the democratic process have been neglected, not completely ignored. One could label these omissions as having to do with the use and reception aspects of news media.", "As an example, a recent excellent study (Curran et al., 2009) analyses the complex relationships between national media systems, news media content, the citizens' civic knowledge, and the state of democracy. These researchers find that there is \u201ca connection between patterns of news coverage and levels of public knowledge\u201d (2009, p. 14), so that \u201cwhat the media report\u2014or fail to report\u2014affects what is known\u201d (2009, p. 16). They demonstrate that there is a necessary causal connection between media system and citizenship, so that \u201cthe public service model makes television news more accessible on leading channels\u2009\u2026\u2009and therefore contributes to a more egalitarian pattern of citizenship\u201d (2009, p. 22). Finally, they predict that since \u201ca growing number of countries are converging towards the entertainment-centred model of American television,\u2009\u2026\u2009this trend seems set to foster an impoverished public life\u201d, i.e. an impoverished democracy.", "It is not that the alleged connection between media system and democracy is not plausible. But the argument suffers from a missing link, which we need to investigate, if we want to understand how this connection comes about:  Media system (revenues, organization)   \u2193   News media: provision, amount and content of news   \u2193    Consumer-citizens' use and experience of news media    \u2193   The citizens' knowledge about society   \u2193   The citizens' democratic prerequisites   ", "Media system (revenues, organization)", "\u2193", "News media: provision, amount and content of news", "\u2193", " Consumer-citizens' use and experience of news media ", "\u2193", "The citizens' knowledge about society", "\u2193", "The citizens' democratic prerequisites", "This missing link is what reception research has tried to provide over three decades, from the pioneering work of Morley (1980), Jensen (1986) and Lewis (1991) to the recent impressive studies of Couldry et al.

The briefest possible way to define what we need to know more about is to paraphrase the catch-phrase of uses-and-gratifications research: \u201cWhat do people do with the news?\u201d\u2014in the process that transforms it to \u201cknowledge about society\u201d and \u201cdemocratic prerequisites\u201d?", "Our current research is trying to answer this question in what we see as two innovative ways. We adopt:  an unequivocal user's perspective, which entails that for news users, news must be seen as a cross-media phenomenon. From a democratic perspective, It makes little sense to analyse the use of newspapers or TV news in isolation.   an integrated quantitative/qualitative methodology, which builds added explanatory power through a research design that creatively merges qualitative and quantitative analysis.

It considers the variety of needs and functions filled by the available news media and genres, from the provision of vital democratic prerequisites, to the supply of lifestyle, celebrity and entertainment materials that serve as an input to the conversations of social networks."]}, {"title": "\u201cDoing Citizenship\u201d: The \u201cCultural Turn\u201d Towards the Microdynamics of Democracy", "paragraphs": ["Theoretically, the project can be aligned with recent thinking in some corners of cultural studies, where there is a growing awareness of the need to relocate the focus of political communication research towards \u201cthe microdynamics of democracy\u201d (Dahlgren, 2006, p. 282; see also Jones, 2006; Schr\u00f8der and Phillips, 2007).", "According to this theory, there is no gap between civic agency as a traditionally conceived political activity in the public sphere and the culture of the everyday: people in daily life may \u201cself-create themselves into citizens\u201d (Dahlgren, 2006, p. 272). In our project, similarly, the practices of daily life are seen as the site of identities and passions from which people can sometimes\u2014if the occasion arises, so to speak\u2014be \u201claunched\u201d into the public sphere, as the site of political practice in the classic democratic sense (Wahl-J\u00f8rgensen, 2006).", "This is also the essence of Kevin Barnhurst's work on mediated citizenship. He is developing a new ideal of citizenship as a yardstick for evaluating ordinary people's political activity. Basically Barnhurst believes that the Habermassian ideal of citizenship is unproductive, because it \u201csets up an unreachable ideal that devalues how people enact citizenship in daily life\u201d (Barnhurst, 2003, p. 134), and \u201crequires levels of commitment to political activity that amount to more than full-time work\u201d (2003, p. 137). Rather than denigrating people's actual political impulses in everyday life as unworthy of the label \u201cpolitics\u201d, political communication research should perceive politics as something that \u201cbecomes intentional only in sporadic flashes\u201d (2003, p. 133)\u2014a view that echoes that of Wahl-J\u00f8rgensen (above).", "Thus, when we explore people's use of the news media in this project, we do so without preconceptions that some media (for instance \u201cbroadsheet\u201d newspapers) or news genres (for instance investigative TV documentary) are inherently of higher democratic quality than more popular forms of news. This agnosticism about the possible value for different people of the different news media is built into our theoretical notion of \u201cworthwhileness\u201d."]}, {"title": "Determinants of News Consumption: Perceived Worthwhileness", "paragraphs": ["What are the factors that determine whether people use a particular news medium or not? We try to answer this question by adopting the heuristic concept of \u201cperceived worthwhileness\u201d. The concept common-sensically denotes the individuals' subjective, implicit or explicit assessment of whether the medium in question is worth their while. An individual's answer to this question depends on a series of interrelated factors that enter into a personal \u201ccalculation\u201d or routine that results in media use occurring or not, and, if it does, for a longer or shorter period of time, with a greater or lesser amount of attention.", "The factors that collectively constitute a news medium's perceived worthwhileness include the subjectively experienced material, situational and functional circumstances that characterizes the medium's practice of use. So far, we see perceived worthwhileness as constituted by five factors: (1) time available; (2) the affordance of \u201cpublic connection\u201d; (3) price; (4) normative constraints; and (5) participatory affordances.", "In the society of news media abundance one can only understand the worthwhileness of one particular news medium by considering the news users as effectively browsing the entire cross-media news landscape as a \u201cnews system\u201d, and each applying the criterion of worthwhileness across the news media that make up the system. As Finnemann argues for the media system as a whole, each medium has a set of distinct properties, while the specific role and use of any medium to some degree depends on the overall matrix of media available. You cannot analyse the role of any single medium independently of the overall matrix of media. (2008, p. 7)1   ", "each medium has a set of distinct properties, while the specific role and use of any medium to some degree depends on the overall matrix of media available. You cannot analyse the role of any single medium independently of the overall matrix of media. (2008, p. 7)1 ", "The commercial and social viability of any news medium depends primarily on two factors: its ability to win a share of citizens' available time and attention, and its ability to meet the needs of citizens for \u201cpublic connection\u201d in a wide sense. If people cannot fit a medium into their time schedule, it has no chance of being consumed, no matter whether it potentially fulfils their need for public connection. On the other hand, if people have available time at some point during the day, a medium can insert itself into that spatio-temporal context, and perhaps with time make itself indispensable in that context, if this medium carries a content which is perceived to be potentially crucial to one's public connection, possibly by replacing a less appealing medium.", "\u201cPublic connection\u201d, a concept launched by Couldry et al. (2007), has to do with a medium's ability to satisfy through its content an individual's need to both equip himself for the role of citizen-member of the democratic order, and for the role of belonging as a community-member in the broadest possible sense. This includes being able to participate in social and cultural networks of all kinds in everyday life, being able to navigate adequately as a spouse, parent, neighbour, colleague, consumer and simply human being in late modern life, being able to communicate sensibly with significant others in one's close networks as well as with more distant others in relevant domestic, professional, commercial and institutional contexts.", "In addition to the criteria of time and public connection, the worthwhileness of a given medium will also depend on a number of additional criteria, price obviously being one of them. For instance, the commuter who buys one of the established tabloids on a regular basis may decide to replace the tabloid with one of the free dailies. The decision to subscribe to a cable news channel will depend on its affordability in relation to household income and expenditure patterns.", "A fourth factor is the normative pressures from significant others, a symbolic factor of potential stigmatization determining whether, for instance, you are willing to be seen reading a free daily on the commuter train. With media that are potentially prestigious among a given group, the normative pressure may work in the opposite direction and instigate adoption into one's media repertoire.", "The factor called \u201cparticipatory affordances\u201d has to do with the participatory qualities afforded especially by Internet news services (Picone, 2007). Although one should not (yet) exaggerate the news users' active participation in news dissemination and production (Gentikow, 2008), it is probably the case that for some, especially younger news users, the various ways in which one can participate in and contribute to the news on Internet sites affect their assessment of the worthwhileness of such news sources.", "It must be stressed that worthwhileness is a concept that has to do, not (as in uses-and-gratifications research) with rational individualized needs for specific media materials, but with socially produced, routinized meaning processes and discursive practices through which individuals make sense of their everyday lives, as inscribed into larger social practices and structures, through interaction with others in the mediatized society.", "Finally, for someone to say that a particular news medium is worth his or her while should not be taken to mean only that the everyday use of this medium (say, a free daily) is \u201cimportant\u201d to them in an absolute sense, having to do with the lofty ideals of acquiring the prerequisites for being a citizen in the public sphere. While worthwhileness does include this sense of importance and indispensability, it is also intended to cover the sense in which a medium can be perceived as worthwhile in a particular spatio-temporal context, such as being available in a time-pocket of a daily 20-minute bus journey from home to work. The concept thus includes both media that are perceived as vitally important and media that come to be contextually relevant on a regular basis, i.e. as worthwhile by default."]}, {"title": "Exploring Worthwhileness: Complementarities of Fieldwork", "paragraphs": ["The project relies on two stages of fieldwork: the first, to be reported here, consists of a survey that maps the cross-media patterns of worthwhile news media of a representative sample of the Danish population.
