In these objectives, they rely strongly on news media reporting of these problems and their solutions. This paper examines the experiences of communication staff from eight large non-governmental organisations (NGOs) of trying to secure coverage of LMIC health stories in the Australian news media. It reports on how these NGOs perceive current Australian news coverage of LMIC health, how they negotiate its \u201cmedia logic\u201d and their attempts to work within and beyond it for better coverage of LMIC health news. Their impressions of LMIC health reporting are broadly consistent with existing literature on the coverage of humanitarian and foreign news. In endeavouring to maximise exposure for their work, the agencies also sought to benefit journalists and news outlets by providing content that matched with existing notions of mainstream news. However, these NGOs are also in the process of working out how to move beyond these outlets and create news content on their own terms. Possible new avenues for the creation of such content are explored.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["News media coverage can focus attention and funding on health issues, as well as contributing to changes in health-related public attitudes and policies (Chapman et al. 2009, 620). Publicity for such issues, and those beyond health, is frequently facilitated by the advocacy efforts of interested non-governmental organisations (NGOs), which are increasingly employing the techniques and tools of media and public relations to their advantage in these endeavours (Davis 2003, 30\u201331). This paper examines the convergence between advocacy by international development agencies in Australia and media attention to global health.", "The NGOs under consideration here are international and humanitarian in their objectives, and engaged in increasingly influential and complex relationships with governments (DeChaine 2005, 50\u201352). These agencies are major stakeholders in the international development arena, significant recipients of both taxpayer-funded official development assistance (ODA) (AusAID 2012) and private donations. However, such NGOs have been little studied in media and journalism research compared to the extent of similar investigations in political science. Thus this paper focuses on large, international development agencies, with their extensive organisational structures, large-scale funding and global reach (Waisbord 2011, 142\u2013145). Unlike past investigations which have looked at these NGOs' general domestic communications (for example, Cottle and Nolan 2007), it concentrates on their health-related media work.", "This paper forms part of a larger project on the Australian news media's coverage of health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Imison and Chapman 2010). Previous, related investigations have focused on exemplar news topics from the media corpus\u2014for example, medical tourism (Imison and Schweinsberg 2013)\u2014and sought journalists' (Imison and Chapman 2012) and audiences' (Imison, forthcoming) reflections on such coverage. In the present study, my interest was in understanding agencies' practical experiences with LMIC health stories in the Australian media. Thus the interviews on which this paper is based sought to stimulate discussion on current coverage, NGO media strategies and relationships, and how respondents felt coverage might be improved.", "The ways in which mainstream media outlets in high-income nations present LMICs have long been perceived as problematic. In general, this coverage has tended to highlight only a small number of issues and \u201csignificant\u201d events, in locations deemed to be of strategic and economic importance to their domestic audiences (Shoemaker, Danielian, and Brendlinger 1991; Wu 2003). A study of Australian news content revealed a similarly narrow choice of subjects and themes in the coverage of humanitarian issues and a preference for \u201cofficial\u201d sources (Bacon and Nash 2003, 11\u201318). Mainstream media are the major means by which the public are informed about international development-related issues (Henson et al. 2010, 18). Although the importance of online information is increasing exponentially, mainstream sources remain central to efforts at public communication about LMICs. Comprehensive and accurate reporting of LMIC news has crucial value to domestic audiences because of the public trust invested in a growing programme of ODA (due to reach 0.5 per cent of Gross National Income by 2017\u201318 [AusAID 2013, 11]), Australia's enhanced international role as a result of its recent election to a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (Australian Government 2012) and ongoing global efforts to agree the form and content of development priorities after the Millennium Development Goals. Despite the complexities in international development and the importance of LMICs to Australia, any case for greater mainstream media interest must be made against a backdrop of decreasing news budgets for expensive overseas coverage (Utley 1997, 6\u20137) and the fact that this kind of news has been found to be in short supply generally during times of peace (Allen and Hamilton 2010, 642).", "Health is a specific area in which NGOs might seek media coverage as it is an important element of these agencies' work, ranging from it being their core business to one area among many with which they deal in their long-term development, short-term emergency response and/or advocacy programming. The concern for health as part of an international development portfolio is a multi-faceted one: building national capacity, working collaboratively to improve public (and not just individual) health, implementing sectoral approaches in preference to single-disease programming and stemming the \u201cbrain drain\u201d of health workers from LMICs, in order to leverage growing investments in health for the world's poorest people (Garrett 2007). However, the media presentation of global health within high-income nations has often been similarly problematic to the coverage of broader LMIC news. In the Australian media specifically, coverage focuses on a narrow range of countries (with certain regions left virtually uncovered) and specific diseases deemed either \u201ctypical\u201d of LMICs or threatening\u2014and hence relevant\u2014to a domestic audience, with a strong preference for an \u201cAustralian angle\u201d (Imison and Chapman 2010).", "In such circumstances, where there is media interest about LMICs in high-income nations, the work of NGOs and news outlets is highly intertwined. While agencies use media exposure to increase awareness about development issues, raise funds for humanitarian work and create constituencies for related policies (Cottle and Nolan 2007, 863), mainstream media news and current affairs programming demands content deemed likely to attract and retain audiences. This relationship, though, can be an uncomfortable one: NGOs develop media profiles in order to communicate their beliefs and actions widely, but this exposure can loosen their control over the way in which they and their concerns are presented (Dogra 2007, 163). While appearing in the news may assist agencies to be recognised as stakeholders and hence receive further coverage, there is little evidence that, in so doing, they successfully change news agendas or challenge normative ideas of \u201cnews\u201d. Indeed, the pressure is on them to co-operate in the reproduction of these normative ideas and generate content that satisfies the dictates of mainstream media agendas, a process that has been termed \u201cnews cloning\u201d (Fenton 2009). This paper examines how international development NGOs in Australia perceive current domestic news coverage of LMIC health, how they negotiate its \u201cmedia logic\u201d (Cottle and Nolan 2007, 863) and how they attempt to work within and beyond it for better LMIC health news.", "Using an agency list compiled by the international development sector's peak body in Australia (Australian Council for International Development 2010), I approached the most senior media and communications staff member at the top 15 agencies, ranked in terms of funds raised from the Australian public, to request an interview. I then let each organisation decide who would be interviewed, depending on availability and personal preference. The large development NGOs are those most likely to maintain media staff\u2014increasingly, former journalists (Braeckman 1996, 122). Despite claims that new media would increase access for other stakeholders in this sector, less well-resourced agencies without established profiles continue to struggle for news coverage amongst competing voices and corresponding decreases in journalists' time (Fenton 2010, 153). In the domestic media's coverage of LMIC health, then, large Australian NGOs will be key news sources (Cooper 2009).", "Research-budget constraints precluded the involvement of one agency based outside Australia's mainland southern states, two NGOs did not respond to repeated requests for an interview, another sent written responses for logistical reasons and three agencies declined to participate: one had only a small portfolio of health work and two had recently lost experienced media staff. I conducted interviews with the remaining eight NGOs and AusAID (the Australian Agency for International Development\u2014the Commonwealth agency that manages the disbursement of Australia's ODA budget) between November 2011 and March 2012, in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. Seven of the participants were male and two female. All signed standard consent forms prior to interview and were assured of confidentiality; pseudonyms are used to identify the quotes below. Interviews lasted between 49 and 83 minutes and all were transcribed and checked for accuracy against sound recordings.", "The interviews were semi-structured and guided by a set of questions developed after close study of the relevant literature and discussion with others in this field (Appendix A). Based on multiple readings and comparison of the transcripts with these interests in mind, I explore three specific concerns in this paper: namely agency media and communications staff impressions of how and what the Australian media covers (or does not cover) in LMIC health; participants' negotiation of \u201cmedia logic\u201d in their LMIC health-related work; and how NGOs attempt to work within and beyond these limitations in the quest for coverage."]}, {"title": "Inclusions and Absences in Australian LMIC Health Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Without exception, respondents spoke of the difficulty in securing a quality and quantity of LMIC health coverage in the Australian media with which they were professionally satisfied. The dynamism, variety and complexity of global health (Garrett 2007) were felt to be barely visible in what was a limited menu of LMIC-related stories. One participant, part of the media team at a large agency, explained it thus: The media view things through a prism that there's only probably four or five aid stories anyway. Then they can view all stories like that. They probably view politics as four or five stories.

Nowhere was this more the case than in relation to disasters, during which NGOs became keenly-sought potential news sources: The time that our phones ring hot is when there's a disaster, and the first 48 hours the media haven't got there themselves usually so they assume we might have some insider knowledge.

The seriousness of events (particularly as determined by the numbers of people affected) must be great or the images available very dramatic to pass journalistic gatekeeping and qualify as \u201cnews\u201d (Bacon and Nash 2004, 37). Just a few locations will be in focus at any one time and media attention subsequently moves on swiftly, offering little opportunity for context or follow-up (Bacon and Nash 2003, 10). In addition, archetypal LMIC health stories are often atypical of such nations' most pressing or widespread health concerns (Imison and Chapman, forthcoming)\u2014especially in the case of stories involving children (Moeller 2002).", "Participants also considered domestic relevance key to the attraction of a LMIC health story, a feature of coverage with three distinct aspects. First, the primacy of an Australian presence in the story, usually in the form of an Australian field worker or agency representative: It's got to have an Australian in it, basically\u2009\u2026\u2009yeah, often they won't want to speak to us unless there's an Australian who can tell the story directly.

It also accords with a previously-noted preference in the Australian media coverage of humanitarian issues for spokespeople who do not come from among those being spoken about (Bacon and Nash 2003, 16), as well as assuring immediately-usable English-language commentary to accompany any story (Imison and Chapman 2012, 100).", "The other two aspects of this felt need to demonstrate relevance for domestic media consumers were an inclination to stories about \u201cthe neighbours\u201d, as one participant termed them\u2014nations close to Australia\u2014and the deployment of issues with which there was some calendar or celebrity link. These were encapsulated thus by the head of media at one of the larger NGOs: I think it's important to recognise that we're going to have more success with Australian journalists if you can pitch to them stories about health in our region. We know they're particularly interested in East Timor, Indonesia, the Solomon Islands, PNG [Papua New Guinea] absolutely\u2009\u2026\u2009and then perhaps pegging them to dates in the calendar.

However, respondents were ambivalent about approaches to LMIC health stories that employed such tactics for the sake of domestic relevance, especially insofar as they might have other, negative consequences: \u2026\u2009particularly because Australian media are parochial\u2009\u2026\u2009the story becomes about the Australian person rather than actually the people themselves.

(Russ)", "Yet in a crowded and competitive media landscape, and despite their misgivings about the principles on which coverage of LMIC issues is often constructed, NGOs worked to maintain relationships with outlets in order to secure their own profiles and incomes (Bennett and Kottasz 2001, 227\u2013228; Cottle and Nolan 2007, 863\u2013864). This willingness to accede to such content requirements is an indication of the asymmetrical power relationship between agencies and the media (Waisbord 2011, 146). It also confirms the operation of \u201cmedia logic\u201d in relation to LMIC health. Next I turn to how NGOs negotiated these processes in their communications."]}, {"title": "Negotiating \u201cMedia Logic\u201d in LMIC Health Coverage", "paragraphs": ["In their examination of development agency media strategies, aimed at raising awareness, funds and public support, Cottle and Nolan (2007, 864) identified four major ways in which NGO communication has been captured by a pervasive \u201cmedia logic\u201d: agencies' concern to promote their \u201cbrands\u201d; the importance of guarding against media-initiated scandals that might damage organisational reputation; NGOs tailoring stories to media logistic and content preferences; and their emphasising regionally-specific and personality-oriented elements as appropriate in development-related stories.", "Most of these elements were highlighted in the previous section and otherwise evident throughout my interviews. Participants were keenly aware that the importance of coverage meant their agencies internalised media ways of working. They also knew that media outlets' priorities in the international development sphere did not necessarily match those of NGOs (Cottle and Nolan 2007, 874\u2013875) and so were concerned to negotiate these apparently irresistible media dictates.", "Respondents were looking for media coverage of LMIC health to assist their agencies' short- and long-term objectives. One participant, the media manager at a large agency, encapsulated his aims thus: \u2026\u2009to get our share of voice out there, get our name out there, our brand out there to support our fundraising initiatives, or to establish ourselves as an expert in a particular area so that people come to us for comment.

This process, though, did not play out strictly on their terms: while the previous section suggested some of the features of LMIC health stories that were attractive to domestic media outlets because of perceived audience interest, respondents were also attentive to the wider media environment\u2014not least because over half of them had also previously worked as journalists. In the context of discussing time, space and resource constraints in contemporary journalism, the media and public relations officer at one medium-sized agency commented on the role of \u201cnews values\u201d: \u2026\u2009they're [news values] basically a ready-reckoner for hard-worked journalists to make a decision about whether I should cover a story or not. So they default to things like conflict, negativity, disaster, the extraordinary or, on the other end of the scale, the familiar and what people can connect to\u2014the regular, the Red Nose Day every year, all that sort of stuff, the local and domestic. So often global stories don't fit within any of those news values.

This, then, would suggest that in order to reach larger audiences with more and richer stories of LMIC health, NGOs need to move beyond the structures and constraints of mainstream outlets. The following section addresses some of the ways in which agencies are beginning to do this."]}, {"title": "Working Within and Beyond \u201cMedia Logic\u201d", "paragraphs": ["Several participants noted that the potential for NGOs' own content to gain a place in the Australian media was greater now than ever. The increasingly straitened circumstances of many traditional news organisations are creating similar opportunities for agency-generated stories in the media markets of many high-income nations (Abbott 2009). It is worth pointing out, however, that, insofar as the NGOs interviewed had begun to move beyond \u201cmedia logic\u201d, these changes occurred largely in agencies' own communication practices, which were not grounded in the routines and norms of mainstream news outlets (Waisbord 2011, 147).", "The major domain in which these efforts played out was online, in various forms which the NGOs were still experimenting with and refining. The numerous tools at their disposal in this space had both clear advantages and some drawbacks: It can be really hard because the conversation [in social media] is so\u2014as I say, a cacophony often, not a debate. So it can be hard to make those messages resonate but we've done a lot of work on thinking through our strategy on Twitter and Facebook and those sorts of things. But our most effective way of communicating with people who have supported us in the past, and getting new people in, is definitely by email.

(Owen)", "This medium-sized NGO had been forced to rethink its communication, to determine what was most effective and had greatest impact with its supporters, an activity that will likely be of enduring value to the agency. However, as another respondent noted, \u201cpreaching to the converted\u201d was a possible danger, given the narrower audience for online communication when compared to that for mainstream news coverage. On balance, though, online platforms provided a real opportunity for NGOs to communicate directly with various stakeholder groups: \u2026\u2009social media allows you to break free of being held captive to mainstream media. So if you're collecting stories you can actually tell the stories yourself and push them out to your own channels and hope that people will share them and push them further and they'll reach a broader audience\u2009\u2026\u2009Again it's\u2014anything that's in the mainstream media magnifies your impacts so much more.

In the relationship between the Australian news media and international development agencies, the balance of power in securing coverage clearly lay with media outlets. One participant expressed the situation thus: \u2026\u2009all news is packaged so you have to make it as easy as possible and as relevant as possible\u2009\u2026\u2009And also vision and pictures and to be honest, something in which people can relate to because I think in many cases editors and producers think it's a turn-off if people don't want to think about it\u2014they're struggling with their mortgage and petrol prices, the last thing they want to be reminded is about someone in a worse situation overseas.

(Nick)", "This approach invites a number of considerations. First, what hope is there for news that is not \u201ceasy\u201d; which is ostensibly important but not intuitively \u201crelevant\u201d to a domestic audience? Attention\u2014which has been called \u201cthe scarcest good in the new media economy\u201d (Tsui 2009)\u2014needs to be drawn to an NGO and its concerns before individuals, then appraised of its work, can decide to further engage with the organisation or the issues (Beckett and Fenyoe 2012, 1). In relation to international news (including that concerning health), the agenda-setting function of the mass media in high-income nations remains important. Previous research has indicated its decisive influence on the salience of both issues and countries, in the relationship between public opinion and foreign policy (Soroka 2003; Wanta, Golan, and Lee 2004).", "Second, the comment above acknowledges a central concern in LMIC-related media ethics (Joffe and Haarhoff 2002, 967), particularly for NGOs (Tester 2001, 106): to have audiences then direct their attention beyond themselves and their immediate affairs toward an engagement with the rest of the world. However, this respondent expresses his hope in a way which suggests that agencies (and journalists) do not expect this to be a simple or one-off process. Another participant described his work as including \u201can element of triage\u201d in relation to choice of stories and the search for an appropriate balance between garnering media attention and possibly putting off audiences (and potential supporters) (Smith 2004, 747). Yet news reports are acknowledged as a potential means by which audiences are exposed to notions of global citizenship and of responsibility for \u201cdistant others\u201d (Chouliaraki 2006; Silverstone 2003, 477). Although currently such reports are often criticised as infrequent and incomplete, they are sometimes able to live up to these cosmopolitan expectations, best encapsulated as an \u201cinjunction to care\u201d (Cottle 2013).", "Third, that stories which do not fit the preferred media mould outlined above do not receive coverage is problematic, given the mainstream news media's otherwise self-proclaimed role of holding institutions\u2014such as large, international development NGOs\u2014to account (Franks 2008, 32). There are negative consequences for agencies as well, in terms of how they and their concerns are perceived: By not being able to discuss the deeper issues of global poverty, the aid industry is often stuck in the space of talking about emergencies and always appearing \u201curgent,\u201d and preventative or long-term projects fail to have that dramatic, footage-friendly edge the media is so often looking for. At worst it turns aid into the face of a starving child with flies in its eyes, rather than everyday people like you and me who have the misfortune of living in poverty. (Jo) ", "By not being able to discuss the deeper issues of global poverty, the aid industry is often stuck in the space of talking about emergencies and always appearing \u201curgent,\u201d and preventative or long-term projects fail to have that dramatic, footage-friendly edge the media is so often looking for. At worst it turns aid into the face of a starving child with flies in its eyes, rather than everyday people like you and me who have the misfortune of living in poverty. (Jo)", "The context for the kind of mainstream coverage that may contribute to overcoming such narrow and stereotypical perceptions, many of which are especially relevant to LMIC health, has recently become much more difficult in Australia. During the last year Fairfax Media and News Limited, the country's two major newspaper publishers, have announced the loss of around 3000 jobs between them over the next three years (about a third of these journalist positions), as well as further organisational restructuring and the closure of printing facilities (O'Donnell, McKnight, and Este 2012, 14). More recently, both publishers have taken steps to reduce costs by cutting the numbers of foreign bureaux and correspondents\u2014even in the United States and Europe, regions of traditional \u201cnews interest\u201d to Australia (Knott 2013). These trends are likely to further diminish both the quantity of locally-derived LMIC coverage and the appetite of media outlets for the substantial investments that such stories require.", "Conversely, these circumstances offer a range of expanded opportunities: for increased exposure of citizen-generated online news content, for media outlets in LMICs to reach global audiences through their own websites and for NGOs themselves to report news, either as their prime focus or in support of their other activities. However, these new possibilities are problematic from the perspective of \u201ctraditional\u201d journalistic ethics or integrity, initiating difficult questions about the reliability and accuracy of news, and audiences' ability to triangulate among media sources (Zuckerman 2009). For their part agencies need to consider, when they are involved in news stories, whether they are acting as advocates or journalists (Cooper 2009). Likewise, accepting NGOs' logistic assistance in the field can force journalists into trade-offs between their professional independence and not wanting to bite the hands that feed them (Franks 2008, 31). What will all this mean in future for the (mainstream and new) media endeavours of international development agencies in relation to the coverage and understanding of LMIC health?"]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The uncertain and rapidly-changing environment for journalists and mainstream media outlets in Australia is in some ways similar to the situation facing NGOs. This raises numerous concerns for agencies themselves, and suggests several possible avenues for future research. As noted in the previous section, the internet offers agencies a way to communicate their messages more directly; an online presence is now essentially mandatory for NGO engagement with supporters and donors. Searle (2009) has observed that, even though most agencies accept this as an element of achieving their aims, many still believe that they can otherwise conduct \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d\u2014which is the position in which many media organisations also believed themselves until quite recently.", "At the same time as online audiences demand greater participation and different kinds of information\u2014often more readily and easily provided by the \u201cnetworked NGOs\u201d that took shape after the advent of the internet\u2014well-resourced, traditional agencies find themselves competing for attention in this space with online destinations that are backed by commercial clout and technical expertise (Searle 2009; Tsui 2009). NGOs might well benefit from the combination of a 24-hour news cycle and reduced news-gathering capacity in the mainstream media by being able to promote their own LMIC health stories. But how agencies then help foster constructive \u201cglobal conversations\u201d of an appropriate level of complexity for different media audiences, and how these debates might proceed in practical terms, remain unresolved (Chalk 2012, 9). This concern goes beyond media coverage\u2014not least because, as several respondents stated explicitly, such publicity is about the issues and not about their NGOs per se\u2014to a broader sectoral interest in new ways to more meaningfully engage citizens of high-income nations with issues of poverty and international development (Darnton and Kirk 2011).", "As digital platforms become more important and online services increase their global reach (International Telecommunication Union 2012), it is worth recalling that their most rapid uptake is occurring in LMICs (Reda et al. 2012, 94). Thus the competition for coverage between those, such as development agencies, who have traditionally \u201cspoken for\u201d others has now become a wider struggle for representation, as individuals and communities in LMICs can increasingly speak for themselves (Cooper 2009). In addition, as large numbers of journalists are made redundant or otherwise cease to work for mainstream news outlets, some are creating and supporting innovative relationships among news organisations, NGOs and others who sponsor news coverage (Abbott 2009) of LMIC health and related issues.", "While budgets for international stories shrink in many high-income nations numerous initiatives in non-profit journalism, particularly in the United States, have sought to fill these financial and informational gaps (Enda 2010). The International Reporting Project (2012) provides for journalists and editors to cover overseas stories under-reported in the domestic media. Based at Johns Hopkins University, International Reporting Project also offers space to journalists writing books and access to its international relations specialists. Further, the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting (2012) promotes engagement with global issues by sponsoring both cross-media journalism\u2014often involving information from and collaboration with development agencies\u2014and a programme of education and outreach for students and other citizens. The Bureau for International Reporting (2012) has two experienced journalist-staff who report on neglected topics and nations, making their stories available through both traditional news outlets and the Bureau for International Reporting's own website. All these schemes are made possible with the monetary backing of American foundations and bequests\u2014a tradition of philanthropy without deep roots in Australia. In health specifically, Key Correspondents (2012), supported by the International HIV/AIDS Alliance and a variety of development and media partners, brings together a network of citizen journalists, many of them HIV-positive, from around 50 countries who blog as volunteers on local health concerns. Such organisations may realise unique roles in the changing news environment.", "While the internet era is usually conceived of as one of information abundance, international news\u2014especially from outside capital cities\u2014is becoming increasingly scarce (Zuckerman 2009). A greater supply of such news would seem an intuitively-desirable outcome for my interviewees, who worked to raise awareness of global health and wider development issues through the Australian mainstream media. However, they were also aware of the role of audience demand in expanding the availability of this kind of coverage. Reflecting on the difference between \u201cselling\u201d LMIC health and other types of news content, such as sport, with established audiences and presumed entitlements to media space, one respondent commented: \u2026\u2009I have a product that's really valuable and people know it's good, but they really don't want to buy it, you know, they want to buy something else. So you're trying to persuade them why they should buy your product, why they should want it. It is, it's a much harder sell. Ten million babies dying is a lot harder sell than one tennis player stubs a toe. (Brad) ", "\u2026\u2009I have a product that's really valuable and people know it's good, but they really don't want to buy it, you know, they want to buy something else.

Ten million babies dying is a lot harder sell than one tennis player stubs a toe. (Brad)", "The extent to which the principal stakeholders in the relationship between Australian international development NGOs and the domestic news media are willing and able to alter how they interact, both in general and with regard to the communication of LMIC health specifically, is a moot point. However, as their audiences become increasingly willing and able to seek new forms of engagement from agencies and different types of news from media outlets, changes in these dynamics are probably inevitable and where they will lead remains unresolved."]}], "references": [{"title": "Working Together, NGOs and Journalists Can Create Stronger International Reporting", "year": "2009", "journal":
