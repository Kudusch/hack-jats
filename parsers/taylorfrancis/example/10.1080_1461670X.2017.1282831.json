The study examined whether women photojournalists are gaining increasing recognition, and gauged whether there are discernible gendered differences in the semiotics of conflict photographs. The image sample was then presented to focus groups in three countries to evaluate gendered decoding practices, followed by interviews with seven women WPPA winners to examine gender in relation to encoding practices, and their gendered experiences when photographing subjects in conflict zones. Findings suggest that the gradual increase in the numbers of women photographers may account for the shift toward \u201caftermath\u201d imagery, but that a complex assimilatory process has wrought an intersection between traditionally \u201cfeminine\u201d and \u201cmasculine\u201d tropes. Women are still under-represented in photojournalism, and, while not wishing to be defined by gender, they have a sense of \u201cdoing things differently\u201d; in gaining access unique to the world of women, women photographers have intimate access to subjects which would otherwise remain under-represented.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In Regarding the Pain of Others, Susan Sontag (2003) quotes Virginia Woolf, who challenged \u201cwhether when we look at the same photographs we feel the same things\u201d, citing harrowing images of the Spanish Civil War: Those photographs are not an argument; they are simply a crude statement of fact addressed to the eye. But the eye is connected with the brain; the brain with the nervous system; that system sends its message in a flash through every past memory and present feeling.

And is this a question a woman is more likely to pose than a man? (Probably yes)\u201d (110). The implication is clear: \u201cput cameras in the hands of women, and you get a power shift and a different, feminine vision\u201d (Sultze 2003, 274).", "Those photographs are not an argument; they are simply a crude statement of fact addressed to the eye.

Research on whether there are gendered differences in the way journalists work and in the content they produce have yet to be extended to photojournalism, beyond personal testimony. Forums have enquired into gendered standards of professionalism, but the data are either outdated or one-dimensional, failing to evaluate how the increase in women photojournalists may have impacted visual content.", "Practitioners themselves \u201chave interrogated constructions of the feminine in their work\u201d (Sultze 2003, 275\u2013276).

Masculine standards \u201care taken for granted and govern journalistic routines, conventions and norms in ways which make them difficult to identify as gendered and therefore difficult to challenge\u201d (Ross and Carter 2011, 1149). Theoreticians have used the thesis of \u201csymbolic annihilation\u201d to explain the underrepresentation and misrepresentation of women in the media (Tuchman 1978, 2009). The lack of women producing news is thus seen as \u201ca serious problem for democratic media worldwide\u201d (Geertsema 2009, 151).", "Researchers have seen the socialisation process within the news industry as deeply gendered (Carter, Branston, and Allan 1998; Melin-Higgins 2004; Ross and Byerly 2006; Allan 2010; Ross and Carter 2011). Women still constitute a minority in journalism as a whole (Beasley and Gibbons 2003; Craft and Wanta 2004), and in war correspondence and photojournalism even more so. In previous studies, women have been shown to focus more on the impact and aftermath of wars, to \u201chumanise\u201d and explore the consequences of events (Christmas 1997, 3\u20135) and give voice to women and non-elites (Beam and Di Cicco 2010, 397). As a result, war reporting is no longer simply about the military (Kennard and Murphy 2005, 129\u2013130). Lilie Chouliaraki (2014) has noted this shift from distant to intimate images in what she identifies as the increasing \u201cemotionalisation\u201d of war imagery, a new intimacy that she attributes to the increasing number of photographs taken by citizen journalists. This \u201cemotionalisation\u201d, or focus on \u201caftermath\u201d and \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d visual narratives has also been attributed to the \u201cfeminisation\u201d of war coverage with the rise of women in the field.", "Scholars remain divided about differences in how male and female journalists cover war, as well as whether the increase in women war correspondents has challenged the hegemonic masculinity dominating news values (Ross and Byerly 2006, 62). Some studies found no correlation between gender and news content (Gallagher 2006). Delano (2003, 273) sees the masculine hierarchy as having been transformed in recent years, since \u201cwomen journalists had become so completely assimilated into their journalistic workforce that they need no longer be regarded as a separate group\u201d. Conversely, Craft and Wanta (2004) argue that, despite continued obstacles for women, a \u201cfeminisation\u201d of news has gradually eroded gendered distinctions in news production. It has been debated whether \u201cchanges in news agendas and writing styles have been associated with women\u2019s growing presence in the newsrooms\u201d (Chambers and Steiner 2010, 54). It's also been suggested that the effects of war on individuals has been given prominence in ways that had not been achieved previously (Delano 2003, 275).", "Although research on photojournalism is growing, studies of the influence of gender are thin (Thomas 2007; Bissell 2000). Caroline Brothers (1997), Birgitta H\u00f6ijer (2004), Barbie Zelizer (2004) and Lilie Chouliaraki (2009, 2013a, 2013b) have articulated the numbing effects of the inundation of images and the ethical problems posed by the graphic war photograph. Little research has been conducted about the total number of women working as news photographers, much less in conflict reportage. No studies have attempted to empirically connect how the gradual increase in women in the field may have impacted visual content on war.", "In our visually saturated news culture, we rely on photographs to convey the complexity of conflicts. This begs the question, as posed recently in the New York Times: \u201cwhat is at stake when a disproportionate number of women are bringing visual stories to major media platforms?\u201d (Booth 2016).", "Interviews with women photographers have revealed the discriminatory practices that they had to overcome: sexism from editors who refused to hire them, photo directors who denied them prime assignments and colleagues who doubted their ability (Ricchiardi 1998; Thomas 2007)\u2014\u201cdamaging treatment\u201d that has come into the spotlight recently in the news (Fremson 2015; Lowry 2015). Speaking about the continued gender disparity in photojournalism, war photographer Lyndsey Addario commented: \u201cI thought that was a dynamic that would change over time, and it hasn\u2019t really\u201d (Booth 2016). Women photographers have added, however, that their gender could work in their favour, allowing access to places where men are not allowed, and having subjects perceive them as \u201cnonthreatening and someone not to be taken seriously\u201d (Thomas 2007, 167). This gendered advantage was commented on lately in the New York Times Lens Blog, in which conflict photographer Nicole Tung reflected: \u201cIn my generation being a woman is an advantage. I never see my gender as a hindrance. If anything, it\u2019s weird how in some deeply conservative and patriarchal societies it gets you further as a journalist\u201d (Fremson 2015).", "It is less clear whether women have contributed something unique to visual conflict reportage, and whether women have a unique visual sensibility in their encoding practice. It has been suggested that \u201cwomen lean toward assignments that tug at the heart and attempt to influence social change\u201d (Ricchiardi 1998, 29), and that women\u2019s photographs have forged \u201ca course toward connection and compassion\u201d (McCusker 2006, 16). However, these observations have remained largely impressionistic without any empirical grounding.", "About gendered decoding of news photographs we know even less. We now know a great deal about women as audiences for fiction (van Zoonen 1994), but little has been done to analyse gendered interpretations of news. British reviews of photography (Bate 2016) and semiotics (Chandler 2007) echo this paucity of research into how audiences interpret visual photographic signs. R\u00f6ssler et al. (2011) found that an iconic image often provokes a strong negative reaction, or outrage amongst viewers. They also found that the population as a whole is not always familiar with those images considered within the profession as iconic.", "The questions about female decoders parallel those about female encoders, asking whether they have different sensibilities in reacting to images of human conflict and suffering. However, an understanding of encoding and decoding requires tools to analyse the code itself. Here we draw on the seminal work of Roland Barthes (1982), as elaborated by Hall (1981), who both used the tools of semiotics to analyse how news photographs function. Our intention was to discover whether codes of visual signs are shared by encoders, decoders and the message itself, and how far the whole process is inflected by gender. While Hall\u2019s encoding/decoding model is not designed to be sensitive to gender, it is nevertheless an appropriate framework, given its semiotic focus and emphasis on audience reception as key within the communication process in news, and its malleability in accounting for the influence of social positionality.", "Hall (1993) shows that meaning is encoded by the sender and decoded by the receiver but that these are not necessarily symmetrical. The photographer can never be sure that their image will be perceived by the audience who gaze upon it in the way that was intended, because of the complex, multifarious nature of discourse. Photographers encode meaning in their image according to their own perspectives and views; this image is then decoded by audience members according to their own perspectives and views, which may result in the viewer understanding something very different from what the photographer intended. Hall\u2019s analysis of decoding positions suggests that the codes available to a viewer are directly determined by his or her social position\u2014gender an important aspect of that position. These negotiations of press photographs are a key aspect of this study\u2014between the visual logic of the image itself, its context in the World Press Photo Awards (WPPA) and global news environment, and the interpretation of the image by (gendered) audiences. The extent to which gender inflects this complex process was the primary question guiding this study, which offers a rare empirical exploration of encoding, code and decoding of the visual image."]}, {"title": "Research Questions", "paragraphs": ["Our main research question was: To what extent does gender influence the production (encoding), representation (code) and reception (decoding) of conflict images?

A photography contest was thus an appropriate source for a longitudinal selection of war and conflict images, defined here as portrayals of social and political (state and non-state) violence.", "A multiple method triangulation design was implemented. The research was split into four phases, utilising one quantitative and three qualitative methodologies. The foundational\u2014quantitative\u2014phase measured whether there has been an increase in the number of women photojournalists gaining recognition through a data-set containing information about 2196 WPPA winners (first, second, third and honourable mention) between 1955 and 2014 from the archives. Biographical data determining the gender of the photographer were retrieved from online research.", "The second phase selected a sample of 76 conflict WPPA images. Of all images taken by female photographers, 48 were initially identified as depicting war and conflict (the remaining images focused on general news, such as politics and sports; portraiture; and daily life\u2014often social documentary). This number was whittled down to 38 by discounting images where the content was ambiguous. This set was matched with an equal number of war and conflict images taken by men, selected randomly given the vast number of war and conflict images by male winners. The sample of 76 photographs was shown to five focus groups, two all-male and three all-female, conducted in London, Singapore and Dubai\u2014three locations known to the lead researcher, and which limited any cultural bias. Snowball sampling produced 30 respondents from 18 countries, aged between 24 and 44. All were tertiary educated and had lived in at least two countries. Participants were shown the succession of images and invited to comment when an image struck them as powerful. Photos were shown with and without captions. Group discussions were recorded, transcribed and subject to thematic analysis.", "In the third phase, seven interviews were conducted with WPPA-winning women photojournalists via Skype or email. Interviews were subjected to thematic analysis. The images singled out for attention by the focus group research shaped the selections of both women photographer interviewees and the subsequent seven images chosen for detailed semiotic analysis, which formed the final data phase (three exemplars are presented here).

Of the counted 2196 winners in the history of the awards, 202 were identified as women. These data are consistent with the recent findings of the Reuters Institute (Hadland, Campbell, and Lambert 2015) that the field of photojournalism is still largely dominated by men. Both sets of data contradict a common misconception that the number of women photographers has grown dramatically in recent years.

However, the phrase \u201cas a woman\u201d recurred in the interviews, indicating an implicit acceptance that gender did affect their photographic practice. One example was that, as an \u201cunthreatening\u201d woman, they could gain privileged access and trust.", "The third recurrent theme was having to prove oneself as a woman in a patriarchal industry. Men were perceived as being under more pressure than women, but were still being paid and promoted more, despite more women entering the profession. A counterbalance to this glass ceiling effect was the fifth \u201csissy factor\u201d theme. Women photographers were more inclined to take emotional risks and build intimacy with subjects, opening out new photographic opportunities. The outcome was a discourse in which the effect of gender was simultaneously denied and affirmed, as evidenced in a comment by one interviewee: In a way, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a man or woman. It\u2019s really more about how you connect with people and everybody does that in a different way.

We\u2019re patient and we\u2019re curious and we want to have that intimacy. Motherhood emerged as the sixth theme. The three interviewees with children conceded that motherhood did affect their career trajectory and made risks seem less appealing. Views differed about how far becoming a mother altered orientations to photographic practice.", "In a way, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a man or woman.

One interviewee, who served as a jury member in addition to winning two WPPAs, indicated that women photographers often appeared willing to adopt what she called the \u201ctrope of male photographers\u201d.", "The final emergent theme emphasised access and proximity to female subjects and their positioning which men by definition could not achieve. As one interviewee put it: I think gender does make a difference in terms of the relationship with the subject \u2009\u2026\u2009 My pictures of men would tend to be graphic, because those pictures would rely on composition because I couldn\u2019t position myself as comfortably.

They placed strong emphasis on personality and professionalism as superseding gendered indicators. This elucidated \u201chow gender is simultaneously embodied and denied\u201d in what Lobo et al.

This paradox is caught by Jodi Bieber\u2019s reflections about taking the WPPA-winning portrait of Bibi Aisha: \u201cWhen I had finished the shoot, I was conflicted because I thought, \u2018Time magazine are going to freak!\u2019 Because I hadn\u2019t done the traditional photograph how I imagined Time would want it.\u201d"]}, {"title": "Cultural Contexts", "paragraphs": ["In keeping with Hall\u2019s framework, RQ4 asked to what extent decoding practices are related to audience positioning in terms of gender.

CAPTION: Bibi Aisha, 18, was disfigured as retribution for fleeing her husband\u2019s house in Oruzgan province, in the centre of Afghanistan. At the age of 12, Aisha and her younger sister had been given to the family of a Taliban fighter under a Pashtun tribal custom for settling disputes. When she reached puberty she was married to him, but she later returned to her parents\u2019 home, complaining of violent treatment by her in-laws. Men arrived there one night demanding that she be handed over to be punished for running away. Aisha was taken to a mountain clearing, where, at the orders of a Taliban commander, she was held down and had first her ears sliced off, then her nose. In local culture, a man who has been shamed by his wife is said to have lost his nose, and this is seen as punishment in return. Aisha was abandoned, but later rescued and taken to a shelter in Kabul run by the aid organization Women for Afghan Women, where she was given treatment and psychological help. After time in the refuge, she was taken to America to receive further counselling and reconstructive surgery.SEMIOTICIAN: The direct gaze of the woman denotes a portrait. The gaping hole in the woman\u2019s face evokes revulsion in its graphic statement of connoted abuse. The natural lighting illuminating her hair and complexion, combined with her bold gaze, recasts the myth of victimhood to one of strength in the face of atrocity. The image combines western and Orientalist elements and is reminiscent of Steve McCurry\u2019s \u201cAfghan Girl\u201d. Her beauty takes centre stage but the crude disfigurement of her face connotes lost beauty and what is lost at the hands of atrocity. The caption information contextualises the image and casts it as iconic of the Taliban\u2019s abuse of women in Afghanistan, and about the abuse of women worldwide, thus connecting it to a broader discussion about the treatment of women.ENCODING: Jodi Bieber: I had made a decision that because\u2009\u2026\u2009I already knew what had happened to her, I wasn\u2019t going to repeat that.

She deliberately encourages her subject to feel good about herself and perceives that the light from the window will help signify an inner strength. This account of encoding is confirmed in the semiotic analysis. The visual signifiers of dress, pose and expression, with the portrait frame and the play of light, simultaneously connote her victimhood and her agency. The myth here of young female (Asian) beauty is twice inverted. Her disfigurement disrupts expectations, inviting us to be shocked. And yet: her inner strength refutes victimhood.", "The audience largely sees what the photographer grasped and the semiotic analysis revealed. Even the men quickly pick up the paradox of \u201csomething pretty horrible\u201d having been done to her but she has a \u201cfirm look\u201d and will \u201ccarry on\u201d. This is deduced from her \u201ceasy gaze\u201d and the lack of \u201cterror in her face\u201d. The women, some of whom already know the image, appreciate her claim to beauty despite the disfigurement\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s beautifully dressed, her hair is gorgeous\u201d so that she can be \u201cstanding there, proud\u201d. The link is immediately made to the positioning of women in relation to education and family.", "This photograph also reveals intertextuality. Little prompting is required to compare this image with one already known through circulation\u2014common cultural transnational knowledge amongst a cosmopolitan middle class, male or female. Still, gender inflects the whole visual communication process as articulated in Hall\u2019s model. Gender is not a determinant of encoding and decoding but it is embedded in their practices. The subject matter of the photograph (a victim of familial violence), the effort to convey defiance and the way this is elicited from the subject and the shot, the sensitivity to specific signifiers of beauty, the evocation of women\u2019s rights\u2014all these are feminine, even feminist, practices. Though the men could decode the essentials of the image, they thought only a woman could have taken it.", "Such findings were consistent across all seven photos. Encodings, codes and decodings demonstrated the existence of common codes of visual communication, elicited by the methods and concepts of semiotics. Only the semiotician can define signifiers but photographers and readers recognise what they are and what they do. The basics of these communication processes are common to both men and women but they are inflected by gender, and this has been well documented. However, what has not gained empirical support until now is the finding that not always, but often enough, what the woman photographer chooses to shoot and how has a distinctive feminine slant, evident in the semiotic patterns and myths of the finished product and yet further in the interpretative repertoire on which women readers habitually draw."]}, {"title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["This study has provided firm empirical evidence of how gender is embedded in the photojournalistic process of encoding, code and decoding. For women photographers as encoders, their gender affected their relations with subjects, especially intimate access to female subjects, which combined with a feminine acuity about \u201cdoing things differently\u201d. From their individuality, unprecedented access or \u201cfeminine\u201d intuition, women photographers have widened and deepened the visual narrative of war photography by focusing on under-represented dimensions in an intimate way. Appreciating the gendered nature of photographic tropes might increase our understanding of gender differences in news production (Geertsema 2009, 151).", "Certainly, men can no longer be exclusively equated with \u201chard\u201d angles and women with \u201csoft\u201d angles in conflict reportage, and such damaging generalisations must be avoided, for they elide the specificity of the individual. Gender stereotypes are being challenged; conflict images by both men and women yielded strong responses from viewers. Male and female photographers have charted new ways of seeing\u2014men adapting to so-called \u201cfeminist\u201d narratives; women defying institutional prejudice and championing humanistic narratives within news culture.", "As a method, semiotic analysis unpacked the conventions of war photography within the gendered framework. It also helped conceptualise the gendered practices which the encoders and decoders of war images habitually use, and elucidated how sophisticated audiences implement a range of interpretative repertoires, from the non-verbal codes of communication through the codes of photography, drawing from their own intertextual and cultural knowledge. Whatever may be its theoretical status in poststructuralist times, semiotics remains the most reliable and consistent tool for analysing the still image; signification is how audiences read visual messages.", "Semiotics is but one thread in unravelling the meaning of a given sign. Within the study of conflict photographs in the WPPA\u2014images that are predicated on the values of the global news environment\u2014a news image can never be detached from its news values and ideology (Hall 1981, 234\u2013235). Following Burgin\u2019s (1982) very early recommendations, photographic theory requires an interdisciplinary approach that engages with processes of signification, and the links between the photograph, interpretative strategy and its ideological discourse. And yet, such interdisciplinary approaches are still rare in photographic analysis. This is surprising, given that the collective meaning of images \u201carises from understanding the context in which the images were produced and within the images themselves, as well as from the minds of the audience members\u201d (Rose 2001, 69). To analyse but one aspect of the visual communication process\u2014such as women photographers\u2019 experiences with photographed subjects, or semiotics in isolation\u2014is to fail to gain a comprehensive picture of how gender inflects the visual rhetoric of conflict.", "Tailoring Hall\u2019s encoding/decoding model to gender through the uniquely comparative data analysis revealed how meaning is produced through conflict photographs. We know that the role of the photographer in the production of a news photograph shapes the image according to established guidelines set out by existing news values, and the iconographic motifs that render an image symbolic of a news event. However, the intended meaning requires the viewer to employ an interpretive strategy that recognises this encoded symbolic aspect through a decoding process of negotiation. To this end, the theoretical framework confirmed that meaning in the image of war is not inherent but must be inferred by the viewer, who employs conventions developed within a social context\u2014here, often gendered\u2014to inform the interpretative strategy. Hall\u2019s model does correspond to actual interpretative practices, at least for these photographers, their photographs and this type of audience. Gender is discernible in encoders\u2019 accounts, the pictures they produce and how audiences respond to them, but works in complex ways\u2014explicit in decoding but implicit in encoding.", "To address the overarching research question\u2014To what extent does gender influence the production, representation and reception of conflict images?\u2014is to assert empirically that the identity characteristics of those who produce the image, those who are represented in the frame and those who receive it are intricately interconnected in the meaning-making process, and that process is inflected by social positionality, in this case, gender. Such a complex conceptualisation of the gendered encoding/decoding of photographs\u2014as key mediators in the relations among global citizens about the precariousness of the lives of others\u2014is central to understanding the production, perpetuation and potential transformation of taken-for-granted values: between distance and belonging, objectivity and subjectivity, and fatigue and compassion in response to suffering in the visual media.", "In terms of photographic practice, it is clear that women are still grossly under-represented in photojournalism. Consequently, the commonly held view that gender is increasingly redundant given the growing presence of women photographers remains problematic, given that \u201cwomen still face systemic gender discrimination\u201d (Steiner 2009, 117). That being said, improving gender diversity will not of itself change firmly entrenched \u201cmasculine\u201d news values shaping what counts as a \u201cgood\u201d news image. Nevertheless, the combination of women photographers\u2019 sense of \u201cdoing things differently\u201d, gaining distinctive access and giving an intimate voice to women and non-elites (Beam and Di Cicco 2010, 397)\u2014particularly in culturally conservative conflict zones\u2014bears potential for photojournalism to have greater depth and nuance, counteracting symbolic annihilation with greater depth and nuance, counteracting symbolic annihilation in press images. Tuchman (2009, 16) has argued that while, indeed, much has changed in the media landscape in the past four decades, the problem of \u201csymbolic annihilation\u201d persists and continues to limit women\u2019s possibilities and opportunities.", "More women wielding cameras may allow marginalised subjects in conflict zones to be represented in a way that does not see them \u201cobjectified\u201d and \u201cdepoliticised\u201d, a view that has been increasingly vocalised by women photographers such as Addario. Within the context of the patriarchal societies in which many of these women work, they have repeatedly raised the sentiment that gender has allowed for access to places and people that her male counterparts would have been denied. Without this access unique to the world of women, those stories remain on the periphery.", "We can progress beyond the visual reporting of the real-time tragedy of war and conflict by giving a voice to those affected by conflict issues and events, using progressive story stances (Geertsema 2009, 169) which move beyond the representation of othered \u201cweeping women\u201d. As the assimilation of aftermath approaches\u2014owing to an \u201cemotionalisation\u201d or \u201cfeminisation\u201d of visual rhetoric\u2014has occurred, indicating a shift in improving the depth in which conflicts are covered, so improved visibility of otherwise marginalised subjects should be advocated through the support of women in conflict photojournalism. When news organisations ignore and stereotype women, \u201cthey contribute to continuing misunderstanding and conflict in the world\u201d (165). Taking the focus group deliberations (critical of \u201cformulaic\u201d images of women and children objectified or stereotyped as victims) into account, working against the objectification of marginal subjects in conflict imagery may yield a global public sphere\u2014and a photojournalistic tradition\u2014made stronger for it. It is with this in mind that encouraging new voices, women\u2019s voices\u2014behind the lens and in front of the lens\u2014should be encouraged.", "In addressing Woolf and Sontag\u2019s opening feminist challenge, the study showed that while responses are often the same in terms of gendered positions, women\u2014on both sides of the \u201cdifficulty of communication\u201d\u2014harbour implicit means of confronting and responding to other people\u2019s pain in a way that can challenge failures of the patriarchal imagination, and the masculine journalism tradition.
