The most recent large-scale survey among professional journalists in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, shows that one in five journalists is a freelancer. Only half of this group is satisfied with their job against 93 per cent of contractually employed journalists. Seen from this perspective, Flanders does not appear to be a very fertile ground for entrepreneurial journalism. Drawing on the database of the Flemish Union for Journalists (VVJ), we conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with a group of freelancers built around three main research questions: (1) What are considered the advantages and disadvantages of working as a freelancer in Flanders? (2) How satisfied are freelancers in Flanders with their work and lives, and what are the reasons for their satisfaction/dissatisfaction? (3) What are the preconditions to make entrepreneurial journalism a success in Flanders? Our results show that there is no \u201cfixed\u201d list of advantages and disadvantages as most features of freelance work (e.g. flexibility in working hours and assignments) can be considered as either or both.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The majority of research on the profiles of journalists and their job careers consists of large-scale surveys conducted among employed journalists working in an editorial team. Freelancers or entrepreneurial journalists are often neglected or marginalized in these studies (Ryan 2009, 648; Edstrom and Ladendorf 2012, 711) and a qualitative research approach is even rarer in the literature. A report of the International Federation of Journalists and the International Labour Office (IFJ/ILO 2006)\u2014that explicitly examined the situation of freelancers\u2014still called them \u201catypical\u201d workforces. Within this amalgam of unsteady employment such as temporary and occasional jobs, freelancers (71 per cent) make up the largest subset (IFJ/ILO 2006, 6). This 2006 report stresses the growing share of this type of employment within media personnel and journalists. The journalism profession is increasingly becoming more uncertain and more intense. The situation in which collectively negotiated agreements were the norm has been changed to a new reality where individuals increasingly negotiate contracts on their own (IFJ/ILO 2006, 3; Deuze 2009). As freelance journalists form an increasing subset within the professional market and since they already make up half of all journalists in some countries (for instance in the Netherlands; Hermans, Vergeer, and Pleijter 2011), the label \u201catypical\u201d is no longer either satisfactory or appropriate. In this regard, more in-depth research into daily journalistic working culture is necessary.", "Baines and Kennedy (2010) make a distinction between self-employment (when the freelancer is insecure, powerless and in a dependent relationship with clients) and entrepreneurialism (in which the freelancer is perceived as having a sense of independence, empowerment and self-direction). They might overlap, but are not necessarily the same; or, as Edstrom and Ladendorf (2012, 713) indicate: \u201cFreelancers are affected by the interplay between opportunity and insecurity\u201d. Lee-Wright (2012, 33) fully agrees: \u201cEntrepreneurialism is a very current buzz-word, with the view that it is fast becoming an essential skill that journalists need to be taught if they are to survive\u201d. New handbooks such as Entrepreneurial Journalism from Mark Briggs (2012) do not hesitate to connect \u201centrepreneurialism\u201d with \u201cjournalism\u201d in order \u201cto train journalists to become entrepreneurs\u201d (Jeff Jarvis, cited in Briggs 2012, xv).", "Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, serves as an interesting case study. The title \u201cprofessional journalist\u201d has been a protected occupational title in Flanders since 1963. Along with the title comes a press pass that makes work easier for the journalist: the pass enables access to information (such as access to official press conferences), includes material privileges (such as free public transport) and guarantees administrative, social, ethical and legal supports. However, this title and consequently its privileges and protection are far more easily obtained by employed journalists than by freelancers. Indeed, one of the preconditions for obtaining the title is an absolute ban on independent commercial activities such as copywriting or work in the public relations and advertising sectors. Consequently, entrepreneurial journalists, who must simultaneously be professional journalists as well as professional entrepreneurs (businesses), encounter conflicting practices with this strict requirement more readily than journalists employed on standard contracts.", "In Belgium, one in five journalists works as a self-employed, entrepreneurial journalist. This is a rather small proportion compared to the general international figure of one-third of all journalists (IFJ/ILO 2006), to the Netherlands (half of all journalists; Hermans, Vergeer, and Pleijter 2011) or to the United Kingdom (a quarter of all reporters; Baines and Kennedy 2010). Freelancers are found foremost among older journalists (over 54 years old) and younger journalists (under 35 years old). Younger journalists are more than others \u201cforced\u201d into self-employment as 69 per cent of them indicate to have had \u201cno choice but freelancing\u201d.", "In this article, we draw on the database of the Flemish Union for Journalists (VVJ) to identify a group of freelance journalists who operate in an entrepreneurial environment. Most of the freelancers in the study undertake work for multiple clients. Those who work for a single client are the exception. To understand more about this category of journalism workers we undertook in-depth interviews with research questions aimed at examining the perceived advantages and disadvantages of working as a freelancer in Flanders; issues around professional satisfaction/dissatisfaction; and the preconditions necessary for successful entrepreneurial journalism in Flanders."]}, {"title": "Freelance Versus Employed Journalists", "paragraphs": ["One in five \u201cprofessional journalists\u201d in Belgium is a freelancer (Raeymaeckers et al. 2013, 9). More freelancers are found among younger age cohorts (under 35s, 26 per cent) and those aged over 54 years (30 per cent). The proportion of freelancers within weekly and monthly publications is significantly higher (30 per cent) than in other media sectors. Among newspaper and television journalists, nearly one in five works as an entrepreneurial reporter, while in the radio and online journalism sectors, freelancing is nearly non-existent (Paulussen et al. 2010, 31\u201332). Almost half of freelancers work for multiple news media outlets on a regular basis, a quarter get work by constantly changing outlets while the remaining 25 per cent serve a single media client (Raeymaeckers et al. 2013, 9). Moreover, journalists who are self-employed but who work for a single media outlet find themselves in a weak position if their patron suddenly changes the rules or severely cuts back on pay rates (Goris and Delforge 2012, 129).", "Journalists in Flanders are well educated. Nine out of ten professional journalists hold a bachelor or masters degree and more than half of them successfully finished a specific training programme in journalism (Paulussen and Hoebeke 2010, 41\u201342; Raeymaeckers et al. 2013, 5). The significant relationship between educational level and working statutes is remarkable: of all freelance journalists only 56 per cent finished university, whereas among employees, this level reaches 72 per cent (Raeymaeckers et al. 2013, 7). Working as a freelancer might serve as an alternative pathway towards a journalistic job in which building experience and on-the-job qualifications may \u201ccompensate\u201d for an initial lower level of education. In the already cited IFJ/ILO (2006, 4) report, Belgian journalists state that less-experienced journalists or starters are regularly forced into freelance work. It remains unclear whether educational level plays an explicit role in this process. In every way, the Belgian findings in relation to educational level do not correspond to research results from, for example, Sweden where the level of education is even higher among Swedish freelancing journalists (87% have a higher education diploma) than among employed journalists (78%) (Edstrom and Ladendorf 2012). Lee-Wright (2012, 23) has pointed out the loss of \u201cmentoring relationships\u201d within a newsroom in which, traditionally, young journalists were supported and trained by experienced newsroom staff. This type of training is mostly lacking today, especially when young journalists work on a freelance basis and have very weak ties with the newsroom.", "On average, a journalist in Flanders works 45 hours a week. This applies to both freelancers and employed journalists. Freelancers, however, have less regular working hours than their employed colleagues. Some 88 per cent of freelancers have varying working hours against 55 per cent of employed journalists (Raeymaeckers et al. 2013, 17). Freelancers also work more during the evening (86 per cent do so regularly to always), during weekends and holidays (76 per cent do so regularly to always, 21 per cent do so constantly, which is four times more than employees) than journalists who have a fixed contract, even though their rates of working evenings and weekends are already high (Paulussen and Ugille 2010, 57\u201359). While in general, all journalists are at risk of burnout (Teugels et al. 2009), self-employed journalists show evidence of an even higher risk (Teugels and Vercaigne 2010).", "The 2012 survey among Belgian professional journalists shows that, on average, freelancers earn \u20ac500 per month less than employed journalists (Raeymaeckers et al. 2013, 19). This difference was not manifest in the 2008 Flemish journalists\u2019 survey, though the distribution of income shows a different pattern (Paulussen and Ugille 2010, 63). Among freelancers, a much wider distribution was, and remains, evident. At both ends of the continuum, that is, the ones that earn good money (23 per cent freelancers versus 7 per cent employees) and those who earn far less than the average wage (26 per cent freelancers versus 9 per cent employees), we find a larger proportion of freelancers compared to their colleagues who work on a permanent basis. These findings are parallel to the results of research into freelance journalism in Germany where only a small professional elite of freelancers earn a high income (Henninger and Gottschall 2007, 54). The same pattern also occurs in Austria where the mean income of freelancers reaches only half that of their colleagues with fixed-term contracts (Hummel, Kirchhoff, and Prandner 2011, 5). The majority of freelancers get paid per story, while others are paid per word or receive payment in relation to time effort (IFJ/ILO 2006, 6). In general, freelancers have to produce more news stories than their employed colleagues in order to receive the same amount of money. Extra benefits such as health insurance, company car, mobile phone or luncheon vouchers are predominantly available only to employees (Paulussen and Ugille 2010, 64). In addition, self-employed journalists have less rights to sick leave and paid leave (10 per cent freelancers versus 85 per cent employees), right to maternity leave (12 per cent versus 88 per cent) and pension rights (7 per cent versus 73 per cent) (IFJ/ILO 2006, 7).", "The need to devote time to financial concerns may also disadvantage self-employed journalists. Freelancers need to renegotiate on an ongoing basis so as to obtain a good salary. Many dislike this part of the job, but it is inextricably bound up with their self-employed status (Goris and Delforge 2012, 129). The situation becomes even more problematic when freelancers do not get paid for months at a time or even, do not get paid at all. In the latter regard, commercial skills and strategies for personal branding are not a luxury but rather an essential requirement for success (Gynnild 2005).", "The 2013 survey in Belgium shows that only half of the freelancers (55 per cent) are very satisfied/satisfied with their job against 93 per cent of employed journalists (Raeymaeckers et al. 2013). In the literature on job satisfaction, a distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic factors of motivation emerges. Intrinsic factors such as level of creativity, variety in daily tasks, multiple contacts, intellectual challenge, autonomy and individual freedom increase internal job satisfaction and focus on the content of the journalistic work. Extrinsic elements stimulate the external job satisfaction and are related to social status, status within the professional sector, social engagement, working hours, work certainty, work pressure and wages (Deprez 2010). In general, professional journalists are more satisfied with the intrinsic than with the extrinsic aspects of their job (Deprez 2010; Hummel, Kirchhoff, and Prandner 2011).", "It is clear that specific disadvantages related to a job in journalism (such as volatile working hours or job uncertainty) are more strongly experienced and felt by freelancers than by employees. However, not all of these are automatically translated into a higher degree of dissatisfaction. As far as satisfaction with working hours (45 per cent) and working pressure (35 per cent) is concerned, percentages are remarkably similar between freelancers and employees (Deprez 2010, 74\u201375). Differences occur when both groups of journalists are questioned about income levels (employees are more satisfied than freelancers), options for promotion (only 7 per cent of freelancers are satisfied compared to 30 per cent of employees), job certainty (only 25 per cent of freelancers are satisfied compared to nearly 75 per cent of salaried employees) and perception of social status (63 per cent of freelancers are satisfied versus 72 per cent of employees). Research by Teugels et al. (2009) has already indicated that journalists who work on a permanent basis estimate their personal competence to be higher than their freelance colleagues. A permanent job seems to be linked to greater self-esteem.", "Thus, when we focus on extrinsic job factors, we see that journalists who work on a permanent basis are more satisfied than their freelancing colleagues. When we shift attention to intrinsic factors, a different image emerges. Freelancers, more than employed journalists, are satisfied with their individual freedom (83 per cent versus 74 per cent), job variety (95 per cent versus 88 per cent), and the multitude of contacts and new people they meet (90 per cent versus 81 per cent). Freelancers score higher on all but one of these intrinsic factors. The exception is individual autonomy, a variable that is mostly regarded as indicating job satisfaction in general. Individual autonomy is located in the extension of editorial autonomy, concerning which self-employed journalists are more negative than employed journalists. The differences are small, but significant (Cannie and Voorhoof 2010, 103). Freelancers indicate more often than employees that their ideas \u201cnever\u201d or \u201conly now and then\u201d lead to a story. They feel that they are less able to influence editorial decisions.", "Swedish research by Edstrom and Ladendorf (2012) connects the job satisfaction of freelance journalists to the condition of free and deliberate choice for self-employment. They distinguish between a portfolio model (derived from Handy 1994; see also Henninger and Gottschall 2007), in which talented, highly educated young professionals \u201care pulled into self-employment\u201d and a marginalization model, in which less-talented media workers \u201care pushed into self-employment\u201d. The former is an optimistic model that stresses the advantages of self-employment, if deliberately chosen, for personal development and career structure. The latter is far less optimistic as many people are \u201cforced\u201d into self-employment to escape unemployment or simply because this is the way the media industry is organized.", "Whereas in 2008 three out of four freelancers (75 per cent) in Flanders still indicated a deliberate choice for self-employment, this number dropped to 58 per cent in 2012. The remaining 42 per cent said they had \u201cno choice\u201d but to work as a freelancer (Raeymaeckers et al. 2013, 10). The former group fits in with the portfolio model, the latter with the marginalization model. The corresponding satisfaction scores confirm the importance of a free choice: whereas in 2008, 69 per cent of Flemish freelancers expressed satisfaction with their jobs, only 55 per cent did so in 2012 (Deprez 2010; Raeymaeckers et al. 2013). Together with the increased number of freelancers, the satisfaction level decreased. As \u2018forced freelancing\u2019 appears to be especially important among journalists below 35 years (69%), the future looks rather bleak.", "Belgian journalists opt for self-employment for divergent reasons, but the longing for freedom and independence (82 per cent) is by far the most important. Other main motivations are family related (24 per cent) or financial (32 per cent) (Raeymaeckers et al. 2013, 10). Approximately 23 per cent of freelancers can be considered \u201cbig earners\u201d for whom freelancing might be \u201ca career opportunity for experienced workers, providing more challenges and better income than work as an employee\u201d (Henninger and Gottschall 2007, 52). Freedom was also crucial in the discourse of Swedish self-employed journalists (Edstrom and Ladendorf 2012): both freedom from (managers, colleagues, assignments, working hour) as well as freedom for (especially family time).", "Overall, we find that the choice to work either as an employed or self-employed journalist seems essential for job satisfaction but at the same time involves risk. In Belgium, a lot more journalists in 2012 saw no choice but freelancing in comparison to 2008. In the 2008 survey, 44 per cent of Flemish journalists agreed with the statement that, \u201cmedia increasingly force journalists to work as freelancers\u201d (18 per cent did not agree, 38 per cent were neutral) (Paulussen et al. 2010, 35). Hummel, Kirchhoff, and Prandner (2011) in Austria and, more generally, Deuze (2007, 2009) point to a steady rise in the number of freelancers, turning the formerly \u201catypical\u201d workers into the future \u201ctypical\u201d ones. This has consequences, not only for the individual journalist but also for the journalism market as a whole. A recurrent notion describing recent developments is \u201cthe loss of the collective\u201d (Lee-Wright 2012, 23). Lee-Wright describes the disappearance of \u201cmentoring relationships\u201d whereby young employed journalists are taken under the wing of experienced journalists to become socialized and educated on the job. Self-employed journalists, in contrast, are isolated and are obliged to rely on their own initiative. Freelancers fall outside the collective structures such as unions and interest groups. As they are not covered by collective statute they must negotiate individually (IFJ/ILO 2006)."]}, {"title": "Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In spring 2012, 71 freelance journalists were randomly selected from the database of the VVJ.

They need to demonstrate the capabilities of a competent entrepreneur working pro-actively to acquire orders with a long-term vision. Using personal initiative is vital, as is investing in client acquisition by offering proposals and by initiating topics for possible news items. A \u201csit and wait\u201d attitude is definitely not an option within this specific segment of journalism. Some freelancers formulate \u201centrepreneurship\u201d very explicitly in straightforward economic and marketing terms: I have always introduced myself personally. I teach my students to operate as an entrepreneur \u2009\u2026\u2009 Make a business plan and that is: what do I need to do in order to realize my plan, my USP, my Unique Selling Proposition?

I have already gone through times during which I had loads of work to do for two months and then, suddenly, it comes to a stop.

They mention lengthy working hours, and a number indicated that they did not want to calculate their earnings per hour for fear the sum involved would demotivate them.

For most of our interviewed freelancers, it was very important to have a financial safety net at their disposal, both during the process of deciding to start working as a freelancer and during financial hard times in order to tide them over. There are regular time gaps between completing work and receiving payment for that work. In some cases, a safety takes the form of financial back-up from a partner or parents, or additional income from a part-time job, sometimes outside journalism. Freelancers also mention the importance of savings as start capital for purchasing a car, a phone, a camera, a laptop or other essential equipment to allow them to operate as an entrepreneurial journalist: I was very young when I started. I was still living at my parents, so that was an advantage. I did not have to pay any rent and that was a good thing, because, in the beginning, it did happen that I had only work for two days out of five \u2009\u2026\u2009 I definitely would advise people not to become self-employed when you do not have any savings. When you start from scratch, do not start as a freelancer. It is better to start doing some temporary fill-in jobs. In that way, you can save a bit because, financially, it is not so easy to be self-employed. It takes a while. The first year, well, the costs are higher than the benefits \u2009\u2026\u2009 You really need some savings. Another disadvantage of being self-employed, is the fact that some news companies are bad payers. I do not get paid every week, sometimes, it takes eight weeks before I get paid. In those situations, it happens that you need to fall back on your savings. When you have costs of your own, when your car breaks down and you have to pay the mechanics, well, then you need a nice little nest egg. (Freelancer B)During the hard times at company X, it was important that someone at home brought in a bit of cash.

Strictly speaking, journalists in Belgium who want to acquire and keep the protected occupational title of \u201cprofessional journalist\u201d are not permitted to accept any commercial non-journalistic work. The rigid application of this stipulation has long been a subject for discussion in journalism circles in Belgium, especially during depressed economic times when paid commissions may be scarce. Some of our interviewees openly admitted to accepting non-journalistic commercial work: From time to time, I even work for advertising companies. Simply because, unfortunately, you cannot make a living out of journalism only, you need to take in a bit of commercial work.

Furthermore, we asked them to do the same for their general satisfaction with life. On average, the freelancers in our study gave 7.6 out of 10 for job satisfaction. Individual scores fluctuated between 6 and 10. In spite of the obvious disadvantages, next to the actual crisis in media, the interviewees appear to be rather satisfied. Some participants wanted to distinguish between job satisfaction and the financial satisfaction connected to their work: Can I split this? Remuneration, that is 5 out of 10.

To a great extent attitudes reflected whether the choice to freelance was \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cforced\u201d. Those who chose freely to work on their own see more advantages and are more satisfied than those who were forced into the role. This finding confirms Edstrom and Ladendorf's (2012) distinction in Sweden between those (young) professionals pulled into self-employment and others pushed into self-employment. Free choice, therefore, is the main distinguishing precondition.", "In our study, we found three clusters of preconditions articulated by freelance journalists in Belgium during the reflective conversations. First, we discussed the preconditions within the professional content and context of the job (1), then we dealt with preconditions within an organizational context (time management) (2), and finally, we focused on preconditions related to the wider socio-demographic context of freelance practitioners (3).", "Freedom, or even more mastery and self-control, are frequently cited words in the interviews exploring these three clusters. Flemish freelance journalists want to be the masters of their own time, their job and their life. Freedom in journalistic work (e.g. choice of subjects, stories), however, seems more difficult to attain than freedom in work organization (e.g. working hours). But freedom has a price: the work is uncertain and seemingly never completed. Freelance journalists need to devote an important part of their time to \u201crunning their business\u201d. Essential preconditions to be successful therefore are business skills and competences with regard to budgeting, time and project management\u2014discipline is a key element, risk-taking, negotiation and presentation (self-promotion). Journalists need to build a \u201cunique selling proposition\u201d\u2014bringing a business value into the ethos of journalism. The traditional divide between the values of journalism and those of business seem to blur, and disappear, in the world of entrepreneurial journalism. It has been argued that there are considerable opportunities in journalism for those who think commercially (Laenen 2011; Briggs 2012). This reality, as mentioned previously, raises issues in Flanders given the Flemish definition of an accredited \u201cprofessional journalist\u201d.", "As we have seen, a successful freelance journalist is not an isolated journalist: he or she is the pivotal element within a broad social network (social capital), he or she preferably has a partner with a fixed income and gets some professional help with regard to accounting and budgeting. Again, an accredited \u201cprofessional journalist\u201d in Flanders can count on the support of the journalists\u2019 organization but as a lot of freelancers are not able to receive the title of \u201cprofessional journalist\u201d, they cannot count on this support. Feedback and appreciation from the environment (e.g. colleagues, peers, clients) is often neglected but is an especially important precondition for (ongoing) motivation. Our results show the need to consider \u201cmentoring relationships\u201d (Lee-Wright 2012) as freelance journalists would also like to benefit from such support. In summary, freelancing in Flanders is not a black-and-white story with all entrepreneurial journalists feeling or behaving as \u201cmasters\u201d instead of \u201cservants\u201d. Unfortunately, due to unsuccessful preconditions and/or lack of appropriate financial rewarding and appreciation, some still feel themselves to be \u201cslaves\u201d.
