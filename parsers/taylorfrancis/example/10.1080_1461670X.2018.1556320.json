Strategic forms of dark participation such as political trolling in user comments have both raised attention and global concern. Community managers are expected to guard the gates of their comment sections, carefully disentangling valid opinions from manipulated statements\u2014with the obvious danger of either censoring genuine speech or letting potentially damaging content slip through. So far, empirical studies on how media actors perceive this challenge and how they respond to it, especially in light of strategic attempts at manipulation, are scarce. The current study aims to fill this gap. Based on a series of guided interviews (N\u2009=\u200925), we explored community managers\u2019 experiences with dark participation in German newspaper sites. The qualitative analysis of the content of the interviews identified four types of comment section managers, ranging from unconcerned gatekeepers to relaxed gate-watchers, alarmed guards, and struggling fighters.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In an increasingly competitive online environment, news organizations must find new ways to attract and maintain their users. Enabling user participation in comment sections or on social media is a frequent strategy employed in this context. User comments can have positive effects, yet such positive effects are discussed mainly in relation to constructive participation (Ksiazek 2018). However, user comments are also an attractive playground for dark participation (Quandt 2018, 1), content spread by \u201cwicked actors\u201d with \u201csinister motives\u201d in \u201cnefarious processes\u201d (ibid. 6). Dark participation can harm a news brand (Anderson et al. 2014; Meltzer 2015), impair other users\u2019 participation (Weber 2014), and allow strategic manipulators to \u201cpiggy-back\u201d on the reach and credibility of journalistic outlets (Quandt 2018).

So far, strategic dark participation has gained little academic attention in the literature on journalists\u2019 perceptions of deviant user comments and how journalists are managing them.", "This study aimed at filling this gap by presenting insights from 25 qualitative interviews with community managers from different German newspapers, addressing (a) their perception and evaluation of (strategic) norm-transgressing user comments and (b) their strategies to maintain the quality of their discussion forums."]}, {"title": "The Rise and Fall of Participatory Journalism", "paragraphs": ["At the beginning of the last decade, participatory forms of journalism and the inclusion of user-generated content became strongly hyped innovations. Partially driven by democratic hopes for a more open and inclusive journalism that involves \u201cthe people\u201d (Gillmor 2004) and partially driven by media managers\u2019 economic fantasies (Vujnovic et al. 2010), online news media experimented with various forms of user participation (Domingo et al. 2008). In parallel with these developments, there was an atmosphere of departure and enthusiasm in journalism research, calling for a re-conceptualization of public communication and journalism studies itself. It is no coincidence that within that spirit of change, John Hartley famously coined the concept of the redactional society (2000).", "Research showed rapidly that the initial enthusiasm did not lead to a total democratic reconstruction of (online) journalism. Instead, journalists defended their control over the production process, opening only small \u201cwalled gardens\u201d for participation (Hanitzsch et al. 2012). As of today, most online news sites primarily offer participation \u201cbelow the lines\u201d (Graham and Wright 2015) in the form of comment sections and other low-involvement forms. Even more disappointingly, only a small share of users actively comment online (Springer, Engelmann, and Pfaffinger 2015).", "Nonetheless, user comments can have a direct impact on the public (readers of the comments), as well as an indirect effect via multipliers (like journalists) and relevant public actors (like politicians). Comment sections are not only read by users themselves but also by journalists and third parties, who perceive them as a vox populi (Lewis and Molyneux 2018, 16). It is thus not surprising that dark participation has raised global concerns (Hofseth 2017)."]}, {"title": "Facets of Dark Participation", "paragraphs": ["Following Quandt (2018), dark participation refers to different forms of deviant user engagement stemming from (a) wicked actors (such as individuals, groups, or states), driven by (b) sinister strategical, tactical, or \u201cpure evil\u201d (p. 41) motives, attacking (c) despised objects/targets either directly or indirectly with the aim of (d) manipulating different audience(s). The spectrum ranges from hateful attacks on journalists up to the spreading of false information via fake accounts.", "On a more abstract level, dark participation can be understood as participation that transgresses certain norms (see also Muddiman 2017; Papacharissi 2004) \u2014 injunctive norms about \u201cwhat users should do\u201d (such as those formulated in a newspapers\u2019 \u201cnetiquette\u201d policy), as well as descriptive norms, emerging from what most users do, behave in an earnest manner (Hedrick, Karpf, and Kreiss 2018).", "Such transgressions can relate to politeness norms (Papacharissi 2004). Accordant transgressions are found in communicative attacks that have been extensively studied in the literature on incivility (Coe, Kenski, and Rains 2014; Muddiman and Stroud 2017; R\u00f6sner, Winter, and Kr\u00e4mer 2016), hate speech (Gagliardone et al. 2016; Hsueh, Yogeeswaran, and Malinen 2015), trolling (Wolfgang 2018), and flaming (O\u2019Sullivan and Flanagin 2003). Often, these studies insinuate spontaneous and emotionally driven forms of rage or anger on the part of the deviant users.", "However, these transgressions can also relate to the norms of honesty and facticity. Debates about the spreading of fake news (Lazer et al. 2018), disinformation (Bennett and Livingston 2018; Wardle and Derakhshan 2017), and conspiracy theories (Kaiser 2017) in user-generated content exemplify these kinds of deviances. In addition, reports about malicious \u201cpseudo-users\u201d such as astroturfers (Ratkiewicz et al. 2011), troll armies (Benedictus 2016), and social bots (Woolley and Howard 2017) have jarred confidence in even the fundamental assumption that user interaction is interaction with users (Hedrick, Karpf, and Kreiss 2018).", "Although norm-transgressing content can spread unintentionally, evidence for strategic dark participation in comment sections is accumulating. In 2014, the Guardian revealed that they found numerous conspicuous user comments throughout the initial period of the Ukrainian crisis, indicative of a much larger, strategically planned campaign to influence Western publics (Elliot 2014/05/04). Numerous other dark participation cases have been reported, such as fake accounts producing comments according to a political agenda (Zelenkauskaite and Balduccini 2017; Erjavec and Poler Kova\u010di\u010d 2012)."]}, {"title": "Increasing the Quality of User Participation", "paragraphs": ["Dark participation is not a new phenomenon. In parallel to digitalization, journalists lost a significant amount of their former power to \u201ckeep the gates\u201d (Neuberger, Lehmann, and Schetsche 2005), often finding themselves stuck in a gate-watching position instead (Bruns 2005). Early studies on online-journalism already showed that journalists were concerned about the emerging potential of abuse (Domingo et al. 2008). An early study on journalists at the Guardian showed that they feel a \u201cduty to readers related to the quality of both the content and the [online] discourse about it\u201d (Singer and Ashman 2009, 16).", "In response to such concerns, most media organizations developed some form of community management. Mostly done by a \u201cspecialized minority of journalists\u201d (Neuberger, Langenohl, and Nuernbergk 2014, 47), community management was intended to increase the quality of online debates (Ksiazek 2015), maintain the health of discussion forums, and avoid legal liability, while preserving the media brand and conforming to journalistic ideals (Braun and Gillespie 2011).", "Three main strategies of community management have been described in the literature: (1) shutting down comment sections for certain topics or entirely closing the gates (Nielsen 2012; Thurman, Cornia, and Kunert 2016); (2) pre-moderating comments (guarding the gates in a more traditional sense, Hermida and Thurmann 2008); and (3) moderating comments after publication or patrolling behind the gates (Ksiazek 2015).", "These main strategies can lead to different moderation behaviors, such as deleting certain comments or blocking some users entirely as specific expressions of closing the gates. We posit that these specific behaviors can be described along two underlying dimensions: interactive versus uni-directional and authoritative versus participative moderation.", "For the first dimension, interactivity, we draw on theories that understand interactivity as a bi-directional communication process (Rafaeli and Sudweeks 1997). Interactivity, as used herein, refers to the extent to which messages by users and community managers happen in a bi-directional sequence and the extent to which they can relate to each other. As such, closing one's gates, including blocking users, is a non-interactive strategy, whereas correcting misperceptions is an interactive strategy (\u201ccollaborative moderation\u201d as Ziegele and Jost 2016, suggested).", "Yet, not all interactive strategies are equally welcomed by users. Ziegele and Jost (2016) found that users evaluated satirical responses by moderators as more negative than constructive responses. We suggest that this is due to the second dimension: authority. Traditional non-interactive gate-keeping has always been an authoritative process (White 1950), but authority can also shine through interactive strategies, for example when journalists satirically mock deviant commenters, thereby installing a hierarchy of superiority (Meyer 2000). Participatory moderation, in contrast, is exerted by letting users exchange their ideas (laissez faire) or understanding journalism as conversation (Marchionni 2015).", "Irrespective of its normative value, interactive, participatory moderation is not standard. Neuberger, Langenohl, and Nuernbergk (2014) found that the vast majority of German journalists reported non-interactive, hierarchical strategies, but only a third rewarded high-quality comments, and less than half of the journalists actively participated in discussions (ibid. 54).", "So far, little research has addressed the question of why community managers select certain moderation strategies over others. Based on the hierarchy of influences model developed by Shoemaker and Reese (2014), different factors on the micro\u2013meso\u2013macro levels might be relevant. The current paper focuses particularly on the micro-level, on journalists\u2019 interpretation of their \u201csymbolic reality\u201d (Reese and Shoemaker 2016, 396), their subjective theories of dark participation. Nonetheless, we also consider certain elements on the meso- and macro levels as relevant parts of the picture, making it necessary to interview a sample that accounts for their variability. We will describe these factors in the following."]}, {"title": "Hierarchical Influences on Community Management", "paragraphs": ["The most macro level in the hierarchy of influences approach addresses cultural differences, which is not of interest in our German-only sample; therefore, we focused on influences on the meso- and micro levels.", "The hierarchy of influences model postulates three sources of influence on the meso-level. The first, societal institutions, describes influences from larger, trans-organizational media fields and the expectations and power structures related to them (Reese and Shoemaker 2016). In our study, we focused on online newspapers. Newspapers have a historical longevity and a longstanding tradition of adapting to changing technologies and different forms of user participation (e.g., letters to the editor) while preserving newsroom culture (Singer et al. 2011).", "The second level, media organizations, describes inter-organizational differences. Although multiple differences might play a role here, we focused particularly on newspapers\u2019 reach and editorial line (the general political tendency of the newspaper) as potential influences (Stroud et al. 2015).", "Finally, the hierarchy of influences describes different routines or \u201cpatterns of practice\u201d that define the everyday work in newsrooms. Such routines can relate to news values and occupational norms as well as to influences through digitalization, for instance, monitoring user responses (Lee and Tandoc 2017; Reese and Shoemaker 2016). In our study, we asked for formalized organizational routines for comment moderation (e.g., a newspaper's netiquette policy).", "Micro-level influences were the focal point of our study. Individual characteristics such as personality traits, professional roles, or demographic features (e.g., gender) most plausibly influence journalists\u2019 subjective theories and behavior. Based on the literature, we considered professional role, gender, and age in our study. Professional roles (e.g., editor, community manager) have been found to be associated with differences in the perception of dark participation (Erjavec and Poler-Kova\u010di\u010d 2013). Gender has been found to influence incivility ratings, with female raters judging comments on average as less norm-transgressing than male raters while simultaneously varying more strongly in their judgements (Binns et al. 2017). Age is associated with the perceived amount of dark participation. Preu\u00df, Tetzlaff, and Zick (2017) found that journalists of middle age reported the highest increase in dark participation over recent years whereas the youngest (<35 years) and oldest group (>61 years) were less concerned."]}, {"title": "Research Questions", "paragraphs": ["Based on the literature review, we formulated two research questions, which guided our work: RQ 1.

On the level of societal systems, we considered journalism as a social system fulfilling a specific function by (a) observing different parts of society and (b) providing observation-based, new and relevant topics (Weischenberg, Malik, and Scholl 2006).

The editorial line of national newspapers in Germany is well-researched, but less attention has been given to the editorial lines of local or regional media (Maurer and Reinemann 2006). Consequently, before selecting media organizations to participate in interviews, we identified the editorial lines of regional newspapers in a pre-study. In previous research, three approaches have been used to identify editorial lines: content analysis of comments (Eilders, Neidhardt, and Pfetsch 2004), surveys of journalists (Donsbach and Wolling 1995) or other experts, and evaluation of reader expectations (Schmitt-Beck 2000). All of these approaches \u201clead to identical results\u201d (Maurer and Reinemann 2006, 180); thus, due to economic efficiency, we used reader, respectively user, expectations as the indicator of editorial line.", "In an online survey, N\u2009=\u2009157 participants (55 male, 87% students, Mage 24.04, SD\u2009=\u20097.95) rated the online newspapers identified as being within the population of interest. Note, we relied on student raters as only a minority of Germans reads newspapers on a regular bases and Germans age 18\u201334 with higher formal education are most likely to do so (Hasebrink and H\u00f6lig 2017). As we were interested in reader or user expectations, only ratings of participants who self-identified as familiar with the newspaper were considered (for a detailed description, see supplementary material Table A). During the survey, participants evaluated the editorial leaning, influence, and trustworthiness of the newspapers in our population. Based on their rankings, we identified six clusters composed of 39 online newspapers (all \u03b72\u2009>\u20090.60, 98% correct classification in a discriminant analysis).", "National newspapers of record with different editorial lines formed the first two clusters: (1) centrist newspapers of record (n\u2009=\u20095, e.g., S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung) and (2) liberal newspapers of record (n\u2009=\u20094, e.g., Spiegel).

The German yellow press-like media (Bild, Express, Vice) formed a separate group of outliers and was considered separately. To represent this variability in the media landscape, we interviewed 50% of the newspapers within each cluster, thus ensuring that different types of media organizations were represented in our sample.", "Within each selected newspaper, we approached the person responsible for community management, that is, the digital/social media editor or community manager.

Yet, from the beginning, comment sections have also been a beloved target of dark participation, leading to the development of different community management routines. Numerous studies have addressed non-strategic forms of dark participation such as the \u201cspontaneous rage\u201d associated with insults; yet, little research has addressed how recent evidence for strategic forms of dark participation have changed community managers\u2019 perceptions of and responses to dark participation. The current study sought to fill this gap.", "Based on a series of 25 interviews with German community managers, we identified four types, ranged along the interviewees\u2019 problematization of dark participation and their strategies for managing it: the \u201cunconcerned gatekeepers\u201d, the \u201crelaxed gate-watchers\u201d, the \u201calarmed guards\u201d and the \u201cstruggling fighters\u201d.", "Answering our research questions, our study showed that it was less community managers\u2019 experiences with but more so their subjective theories about (strategic) dark participation that shaped their moderation practices. Those who perceived dark participation as a normal part of human behavior and who trusted in their users\u2019 positive engagement were less concerned and more willing to engage in participatory, interactive moderation, strategies more closely resembling the democratic hopes accompanying early participatory journalism (Domingo et al. 2011). Although the relaxed gate-watchers were the largest group in our sample, the majority of comment sections was far away from democratic ideals such as reciprocity (Lewis, Holton, and Coddington 2014) or conversation (Marchionni 2015), most interview partners reported rather uni-directional, authoritative moderation routines.", "We also explored hierarchical influences of interviewees\u2019 perception and moderation practices. Although our interviews are not suitable to confirm or reject hypotheses about the relationships between these meso- or micro-level factors, we will discuss some of the characteristics among our different types to identify fruitful venues for future research.", "On the meso-level of media organizations, we recruited our sample such that different media organizations in terms of reach and editorial line were included. There were some hints that newspapers with a larger reach could be associated with more dark participation and attempts at strategic manipulation. However, reach was not directly related to participants\u2019 community management approach: Interviewees working at the three largest newspapers in our sample all belonged to the relaxed gate watcher type. Although we did not find a clear pattern linking experiences with dark participation and editorial line, there was a relatively high share of alarmed guards and struggling fighter types working for liberal newspapers, whereas the relative share of relaxed and unconcerned interviewees was larger for centrist, conservative, and yellow press media. Nonetheless, newspapers of all editorial lines were found across types. As such, future research is needed examining the link between editorial line and dark participation in more detail.", "On the micro-level of individuals (see also Table 2), there were interesting patterns regarding age and gender. The unconcerned gatekeepers were the oldest group in our sample, whereas the relaxed gate-watchers were the youngest. Although our sample was much too small for statistical examination of this pattern, and the age differences were small, an earlier survey by Preu\u00df, Tetzlaff, and Zick (2017) found a similar U-shaped pattern for the association between age and perceptions of dark participation. Regarding gender, the interviewees of the alarmed guards and struggling fighter types were mostly women (eight out of nine). On the other end of the spectrum, only one woman was categorized as an unconcerned gatekeeper. Prior research has found that women evaluate norm-transgressing content as less severe than do their male counterparts, but women also show larger variability in their judgement (Binns et al. 2017). Partially, our findings are compatible with this, as women were found across all four types, but men were not. However, as we found a particularly high proportion of women in the two \u2018problematizing\u2019 groups, future research into the role of gender in evaluating norm-transgressing user comments is necessary.", "Notwithstanding, our study has some limitations. First, we interviewed only German journalists. As such, the results might not be generalizable to other cultures and media systems (Hanitzsch et al. 2010). Second, we focused only on larger \u201cmainstream\u201d media. Extending our study to local or alternative newspapers might provide further insights.", "Finally, we examined subjective interpretations and based our analysis only on qualitative data. Although our typology points toward the relevance of journalists\u2019 subjective theories in shaping their moderation practices, future research using larger samples and additional objective measures (e.g., observation of content moderation or actual experiments) are necessary to put our findings on solid ground. Nonetheless, our study allows initial insights into community managers\u2019 perceptions and handling of dark participation in an age where strategic manipulation appears to be increasing."]}], "references": [{"title": "The \u2018Nasty Effect\u2019: Online Incivility and Risk Perceptions of Emerging Technologies", "year": "2014", "journal": "Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication", "volume": "19", "authors": [{"name": "Anderson Ashley A.", "first_name": "Anderson", "last_name": "A."}, {"name": "Brossard Dominique", "first_name": "Brossard", "last_name": "Dominique"}, {"name": "Scheufele Dietram A.", "first_name": "Scheufele", "last_name": "A."}, {"name": "Xenos Michael A.", "first_name": "Xenos", "last_name": "A."}, {"name": "Ladwig Peter", "first_name": "Ladwig", "last_name": "Peter"}]}, {"title": "Invasion of the Troll Armies: From Russian Trump Supporters to Turkish State Stooges", "year": "2016", "journal": "The Guardian", "volume": "", "authors": [{"name": "Benedictus Leo.", "first_name": "Benedictus", "last_name": "Leo."}]}, {"title": "The Disinformation Order: Disruptive Communication and the Decline of Democratic Institutions", "year": "2018", "journal": "European Journal of Communication", "volume": "33", "authors": [{"name": "Bennett Lance W", "first_name": "Bennett", "last_name": "W"}, {"name": "Livingston Steven", "first_name": "Livingston", "last_name": "Steven"}]}, {"title": "Hosting the Public Discourse, Hosting the Public", "year": "2011", "journal": "Journalism Practice", "volume": "5", "authors": [{"name": "Braun Joshua", "first_name": "Braun", "last_name": "Joshua"}, {"name": "Gillespie Tarleton", "first_name": "Gillespie", "last_name": "Tarleton"}]}, {"title": "Observing the Dynamics of the Online News Ecosystem", "year": "2018", "journal": "Journalism Studies", "volume": "19", "authors": [{"name": "Buhl Florian", "first_name": "Buhl", "last_name": "Florian"}, {"name": "G\u00fcnther Elisabeth", "first_name": "G\u00fcnther", "last_name": "Elisabeth"}, {"name": "Quandt Thorsten", "first_name": "Quandt", "last_name": "Thorsten"}]}, {"title": "The Misconception of Online Comment Threads: Content and Control on Local Newspaper Websites", "year": "2013", "journal": "Journalism Practice", "volume": "7", "authors": [{"name": "Canter Lilly.", "first_name": "Canter", "last_name": "Lilly."}]}, {"title": "Online and Uncivil?
