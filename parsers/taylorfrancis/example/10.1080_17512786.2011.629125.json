Results of a national survey of US Internet users suggested that despite the excitement about newer, more portable devices, not all devices are equally \u201cnewsful.\u201d Most people use only one electronic device for news purposes on a weekly basis.

", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The American newspaper industry has been experimenting with online delivery for more than a decade. The New York Times launched its Web edition in 1996; since then, most news organizations have been delivering content through the Internet. Propelled further by technological advances such as smartphones (e.g., Apple's iPhone) and e-book readers (e.g., Amazon's Kindle), news publishers explored news delivery through mobile devices. More recently, the launch of the computer tablet\u2014the iPad\u2014by Apple Inc. in April 2010 has renewed the excitement and newspaper publishers are scrambling to create new versions of their paper especially for this device (Art of the iPhone, 2011). It is indeed difficult to find a technology that newspapers do not embrace (Picard, 2009).", "Newspapers are knee-deep in explorations of various online delivery channels and have shifted a substantial amount of their dwindling resources from their print editions to new devices, believing that younger readers will embrace these devices as new sources of news and information. Overall, most American media companies have adopted a 360-degree strategy that incorporates taking content decisions \u201cshaped by the potential to generate consumer value and returns through multiple platforms of expression of that content and via a number of distributive outlets\u201d (Doyle, 2010, p. 432). In other words, a 360-degree strategy is one adopted by media companies to engage audiences with content across the various platforms available, such as creating television programming that also includes a plan for Web and mobile content (Parker, 2007).", "The idea of commissioning content that is suitable for and available over more than one platform has also been adopted by media companies in Europe given the increasing number of multi-platform consumers. A research report (Caras, 2010) stated that there are 19 million multi-screen consumers across the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands and Sweden, who own and use a TV and access the Internet via a computer and smartphone on a weekly basis. In an attempt to get the attention of these consumers, media companies such as the British Broadcasting Corporation announced changes in its programming and commissioning approach to reflect the evolving media scenario (BBC, 2006). Sweden's public service channel (SVT) also moved towards producing multi-platform content (Bolin, 2009).", "Despite investments in these new platforms and consciously diversifying their product portfolios, it is not clear whether media corporations will reap the kind of profits they envisage or news consumers will adopt their new products with the readiness they expect and forecast. Take American media companies' Web operations, for example\u2014after 15 years of experimentation, only 10 percent of the newspaper's total advertising revenue comes from this avenue (Newspaper Association of America, 2011). As newspaper companies explore newer ways of delivery with the same excitement, are they really gaining new ground? At the end of the day, it is consumer demand that will determine the future of the news industry. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to investigate whether multi-platform news consumption is a reality and the extent to which people own, use, and perceive multiple electronic devices. Based on a national survey of US Internet users, this study examines the ownership of these devices and news use on them. We have also tried to extrapolate whether news companies ought to focus their limited resources on these new avenues rather than their traditional/legacy media platforms."]}, {"title": "Literature Review", "paragraphs": ["The average American news consumer has never had nearly as many choices for news consumption as today. More people in the United States now own wireless devices such as computer notebooks and netbooks, smartphones, e-book readers, and tablets compared to before. A recent study by Pew Internet research stated that 59 percent of American adults used a wireless connection by means of a computer or cell phone to access the Internet (Smith, 2010a). With so many gadgets permeating the market and offering a myriad of platforms and options for people to access media, news businesses have begun targeting this fragmented market through convergence and adoption of a multi-platform strategy towards content production.", "Digitization of news content and processes have led to easy flow and facilitation of data files across various platforms such as print, radio and television, thus leading to \u201cmedia convergence\u201d (Avil\u00e9s and Carvajal, 2008). In other words, contemporary audiences are cross-platform consumers who consume media through various channels (Albarran, 2010). No longer are they restricted to a newspaper, a television channel or a radio. They can now get the same content via their computer tablets, cell phones, podcasts, e-readers and other mobile devices. Media scholars have found it difficult to come up with a conceptualization of convergence that is agreed upon by all (Dailey et al., 2005). Researchers have either defined it as a coming together of disparate media entities such as print, broadcast and online news organizations and their consequent converged outputs or an internal integration of broadcast or print and online newsrooms within the same organization (Thurman and Lupton, 2008). In his book Convergence Culture: Where old and new media collide, author Henry Jenkins (2006) wrote that convergence encouraged news consumers to seek new information across different platforms and make sense of it for themselves despite the content's dispersed state and this is how we have also approached the concept for the purpose of this paper.", "Continual technological advances have forced media companies to keep up with the changing times and transform themselves into multi-platform media enterprises (Albarran, 2010), producing and offering more than one product in the market. Spreading themselves across various platforms and developing \u201ccross-media product portfolios\u201d (Picard, 2005, p. 1) not only helps media companies reduce their risk of loss from events such as product failure, decreasing demand and changing business cycles but also helps them to explore new revenue streams.1 However, managing a cross-media portfolio also creates new challenges because it becomes increasingly difficult to enumerate user demand.", "Multimedia platform and cross-media portfolio approaches have led to what is known as the 360-degree strategy to target consumers who may own and use more than one electronic device to engage with media (Parker, 2007). This involves strategic decisions related to content from the conceptual stage that are focused toward generating consumer value and returns through multiple forms of expression of that content via a number of distributive outlets such as online, mobile and games (Doyle, 2010). For example, The New York Times not only offers a paper product, but also a news site on the Web as well as news applications (apps) for various smartphones such as iPhones, Android-based phones and tablets such as the iPad. As a result, the content created by the company, while similar, is produced keeping each individual platform in mind. However, in order to gain any success in expanding across platforms and operate the cross-media portfolios, it is important for media companies to regularly re-evaluate and analyze their product offerings and adapt to changing market conditions so as to direct their resources towards those that are important to the company (Picard, 2005).", "In an attempt to examine and analyze media companies' product offerings bearing the introduction of new technological devices in mind, this study first sought to document the adoption rate (i.e., the percentage of the population that own or have regular access to a particular technology) of seven types of electronic technologies: (1) computers,2 (2) netbooks,3 (3) iPhones,4 (4) other smartphones,5 (5) iPod Touch,6 (6) e-book readers,7 and (7) iPads,8 addressing the following research question:  RQ1:\u2003What are the adoption rates of various electronic devices?  ", " RQ1:\u2003What are the adoption rates of various electronic devices?", "Adoption rate, a key concept in the diffusion of innovations theory, serves as an indicator of the extent to which a new technology undergoes a diffusion process in a social system (Rogers, 2003). However, the adoption rate of a multi-purpose technology (such as a smartphone) only indicates the availability of that technology as a potential news device, because ownership does not necessarily translate into use for news purposes. It is thus important to also examine the percentage of the population that actually uses these devices to access news. Therefore, we proposed our second research question:  RQ2:\u2003To what extent do people access news through their owned devices?  ", " RQ2:\u2003To what extent do people access news through their owned devices?", "The underlying logic of media companies adopting multi-platform strategies is based on the belief that these are new ways of ensuring they do not lose their audiences and continue to reach out to them. Consumers may choose to read the news online instead of paper but the idea is they should continue to read the news (Avriel, 2007). It would seem natural to assume that users of Internet-enabled new devices might also use them to read the news, but such an assumption may be oversimplifying the reality. According to David Mindich, author of Tuned Out: why Americans under 40 don't follow the news, most young people go online \u201cfor anything but news\u201d (2005, p. 4). The same complexity may characterize the use of mobile devices. Smartphones, e-readers, and tablets are all multifunctional devices that are not designed specifically for news purposes. Smartphones, despite being highly portable devices, have relatively small screens. A recent Pew study shows only 11 percent of the American adult population reported having an app on their smartphones or tablets for local news and information and only 1 percent pays for these apps (Purcell et al., 2011). The Kindle, one of the most popular e-book readers, often described as \u201cmore suited to reading,\u201d still lacks color displays. The New York Times, the most popular newspaper title on the Kindle (Benton, 2008a), had only 10,000 subscribers in late 2008 (Benton, 2008b). A 2009 article in Time magazine asked, \u201cWill Amazon's Kindle Rescue Newspapers?\u201d (Quittner, 2009), implying that just as the e-reader gave a seemingly new lease of life to the trade books, the same outcome could be expected for newspapers. Such high (and false?) hopes were soon replaced by expectations for something newer\u2014the iPad\u2014another multi-purpose device.", "Although academic interest in communication technology has been reflected on several long-standing paradigms such as diffusion of innovations and uses and gratifications,9 we found no relevant concept handling specifically the complexity associated with or resulting from the multi-faceted nature of multi-purpose devices. Therefore, to determine various devices' applicability for news consumption, this study introduces a new concept, newsfulness, to measure the likelihood that a device or gadget is used for news. The unit of analysis is the technology, as opposed to individual users (as often is the case in uses and gratifications research). This concept captures the propensity that a multi-purpose device is used for news and allows researchers to make comparisons across various technologies, which, in turn, would enable the evaluation of different publishing platforms from the portfolio management perspective. Therefore, the analysis sought to determine how \u201cnewsful\u201d each electronic device is by addressing the following research question:  RQ3:\u2003How \u201cnewsful\u201d is each of the seven multi-purpose devices?  ", " RQ3:\u2003How \u201cnewsful\u201d is each of the seven multi-purpose devices?", "Media researchers have found that simultaneous use of multiple news media is common among Internet news users (Chyi and Huang, 2011; Chyi et al., 2010; Nguyen and Western, 2006). The researchers also found that those who relied on the Internet for news and information still used traditional sources quite substantially. These results are in keeping with Everett Rogers' idea that adoption of one idea could lead to the adoption of others and he conceptualized technology clusters as, \u201cone or more distinguishable elements of technology that are perceived as being interrelated\u201d (2003, p. 249). These studies underscore the relationship between online and traditional or legacy media use\u2014consumers of one medium were highly likely to use the other.", "Technologies that form a cluster would then have similar functional characters or satisfy the same underlying needs (LaRose and Atkin, 1992). For example, iPods can be perceived as compatible with personal computers and, therefore, belong to the same technology cluster; an individual who owns a personal computer is more likely to buy an iPod compared to an individual who does not own a personal computer (Vishwanath and Chen, 2006).", "Media scholars have found a positive relationship between previous use of technologies and early adoption of a new innovation that is similar. Westlund (2008) examined news use specifically on mobile devices by analyzing data from five national surveys carried out during 2005, 2006 and 2007 in Sweden and found that usage of mobile devices was higher among those who went online often, thus pointing to a technology dimension related to the use of mobile devices for news services. Further analysis showed that frequent users of online newspapers have adopted a mobile device as a news medium to a higher extent than the general public. The author concluded that use of mobile devices for news was more common among people who possess other technologies such as MP3 players, laptops, home theater systems and more. Kang (2002) found that people who watch television, have premium channels and evaluate their cable operator as innovative towards technology were more likely to upgrade to new cable services, sooner than their counterparts who did not display these behaviors. Vishwanath and Chen (2006) found that early adopters tend to perceive innovations as complementary since they relate to technologies based on their functional similarity. They are therefore likely to adopt related technologies.", "Given that previous research has found a relationship in adoption between mobile phones and online access as well as grouped iPods with computer use, our study expanded this set to include e-readers and the iPad, proposing the following hypotheses:  H1:\u2003There is a positive relationship between the ownership of one device and the ownership of other devices.    H2:\u2003There is a positive relationship between the use of one device for news and the use of other devices for news.  ", " H1:\u2003There is a positive relationship between the ownership of one device and the ownership of other devices. ", " ", "H2:\u2003There is a positive relationship between the use of one device for news and the use of other devices for news.", "A recent Pew survey (Smith, 2010b) revealed that from an array of devices (cell phones, desktop computers, laptop computers, MP3 players, game consoles, e-book readers and tablet computers), eight in 18 American adults (78 percent) owned two or more of these devices. The study also showed that, while adults under the age of 45 tended to own up to four devices, those between the ages of 55 and 64 years owned two devices and those aged 65 years and older tended to own one device. However, they did not specify whether, how, or from what devices they accessed news and information. Thus the information relevant to journalism researchers and the news industry is how many people actually access news on multiple devices. In other words, to what extent is news use through new devices a reality? In addition, this study sought to examine what factors account for the ownership of as well as news use on multiple devices, addressing the following research questions:  RQ4:\u2003To what extent do people access news across multiple platforms?

For example, previous research shows that online news is perceived as less credible (Amsbary and Powell, 2003), less likeable (Chyi and Chang, 2009), less useful (De Waal et al., 2005), less preferred (Chyi and Lasorsa, 2002), or inferior (Chyi and Yang, 2009) when compared with traditional media.", "Specifically, this study examined media enjoyment, which has primarily been studied as a pleasurable response to entertainment media (Tamborini et al., 2010). Most communication researchers use the term \u201cenjoyment\u201d to explain positive reactions towards media (Raney and Bryant, 2002; Vorderer et al., 2004) and have explored the relationship between people's exposure to certain kinds of content and their reported level of enjoyment (Denham, 2004). In journalism research, however, \u201cenjoyment\u201d as a concept has remained understudied. As new and old media co-evolve, cross-media differences, as perceived by users, carry important implications regarding the competitive advantage of news delivered through various devices.

Compared with Random Digit Dialing (RDD), online surveys offer obvious benefits such as the speed, the elimination of interviewer bias, lower cost, allowing respondents to choose when and where to complete the survey, and lowering the intrusiveness associated with telephone surveys and the social desirability effect (Fisher, 2005). On the other hand, panel-based surveys are subject to coverage issues because only 74 percent of US adults were online as of 2010 (Rainie, 2010). Moreover, response rates tend to be low and the difference between those who volunteer to take the survey and those who do not may be a source of bias (Baker, 2010).", "The response rate of this survey was 4 percent. This represents a low, but not unusual response rate for an online-based survey (Baker, 2010).

To ensure that the demographic characteristics of the sample closely match the demographic characteristics of the Internet population in the United States, we took a common post-survey adjustment approach\u2014standard demographic weighting (Baker, 2010) and weighted the data to gender and income.

Overall, the daily news access rate for all but one electronic device (desktop/laptop computer being the exception) is below 0.35, which means, of all who own these devices, only a third or less use them for news every day. This leads us to believe that these devices (netbooks, smartphones, iPod Touch, e-readers, and iPad) are not very \u201cnewsful\u201d or conducive to accessing online news.

Interestingly, when the same analysis was run on three traditional platforms\u2014namely print newspapers, television and news magazines\u2014the average number of platforms used for news access is 1.6. This is a fairly strong indication that traditional news platforms, despite a shrinking user base, still play an important role in providing information to the news consumer. It is yet another reiteration of the fact that media companies must approach new technologies with a mix of enthusiasm and caution; they must not do so at the cost of their traditional offerings, which remain their core products and primary revenue drivers.", "Despite the growing audience adoption and usage of new devices, our analysis showed that, compared with traditional platforms, newer devices do not yield a more enjoyable user experience.

Clearly, traditional platforms have not reached the end of their road just yet. Adoption of new devices is still fairly low and while this number may increase in the future,15 our study indicates that ownership of these devices may not translate into their being \u201cnewsful.\u201d We believe that while new technologies do seem promising and may possibly hold some effective solutions for the struggling news industry, traditional or legacy media will continue to play an important role in providing news to the interested consumer.", "In the latest \u201cState of the News Media\u201d report, Rosenstiel and Mitchell (2011) carried a word of caution about multi-platform news distribution: \u201cEach technological advance has added a new layer of complexity\u2014and a new set of players\u2014in connecting that content to consumers and advertisers.\u201d This is because multi-platform news organizations increasingly rely on aggregators (Google, Yahoo!) and social networks (Facebook, Twitter) to help draw audiences and must follow the rules of device manufacturers (Apple) and software developers (Google) to get their content delivered. What is worse, each new player takes a share of the revenue and in many cases, also controls audience information (Rosenstiel and Mitchell, 2011).", "From the product portfolio management perspective, false hopes often lead to bad decisions such as killing or deprioritizing existing products that generate most of the revenue. Therefore, media firms should differentiate their primary products from secondary ones (Picard, 2005) by evaluating how users respond to their cross-media product offerings with reality-based data to develop proper portfolio management strategies.", "The data were collected through an online survey. As a result, all respondents were computer users with Internet access and people without Internet access were not included in the sample. Because all respondents were computer users, they may favor the computer as a news platform. Yet, had the survey been able to include people with no Internet access, one would expect that the degree of news consumption through electronic devices would have been even lower than what was presented here. In the United States, the adoption rate of the computer is higher than that of most mobile technologies, and most mobile devices (e.g., iPodTouch and iPad) require users connect such devices to a computer to be activated or managed by applications developed by the manufacturer (e.g., iTunes). So surveying Internet users through a Web-based survey means that most mobile device users were included in the sample. However, given the response rate, we do not have sufficient information to determine the attitudinal and behavioral difference between those who volunteered to take the survey versus those who did not. By weighting the data, we hope that we have addressed at least part of the issue.", "We found that, among the seven electronic devices studied here, people are most likely to use their computers\u2014desktops or laptops\u2014to access news. Results as such may not be as applicable in developing nations where computer access is rather limited. For example, only 22.5 percent of the households in developing countries have a computer compared to 71 percent in developed countries (International Telecommunication Union, 2010). Additionally, even though cell phone access tends to be more common than computer access in developing countries (International Telecommunication Union, 2010), low Internet penetration in those regions leads us to speculate that not many people access news online.16 ", "Despite these limitations, this study attempted to serve as a timely and systematic examination of multi-platform news consumption, taking into consideration all electronic devices that granted news access at the time of the survey. Future studies should continue monitoring the adoption rate of these devices, their newsfulness, as well as each platform's cost-effectiveness and ROI (return on investment) as media companies keep rolling out new services on new devices."]}], "references": [{"title": "Factors Influencing Evaluations of Web Site Information", "year": "2003", "journal": "Psychological Reports", "volume": "93", "authors": [{"name": "Amsbary Jonathan Howard", "first_name": "Amsbary", "last_name": "Howard"}, {"name": "Powell Larry", "first_name": "Powell", "last_name": "Larry"}]}, {"title": "Integrated and Cross-media Newsroom Convergence: two models of multimedia news production\u2014the cases of Novot\u00e9cnica and La Verdad Multimedia in Spain", "year": "2008", "journal": "Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies", "volume": "14", "authors": [{"name": "Avil\u00e9s Jos\u00e9 Alberto Garc\u00eda", "first_name": "Avil\u00e9s", "last_name": "Garc\u00eda"}, {"name": "Carvajal Miguel", "first_name": "Carvajal", "last_name": "Miguel"}]}, {"title": "Demystifying the Demand Relationship Between Online and Print Products Under One Newspaper Brand: the case of Taiwan and the emergence of a universal pattern", "year": "2011", "journal": "Asian Journal of Communication", "volume": "21", "authors": [{"name": "Chyi Hsiang Iris", "first_name": "Chyi", "last_name": "Iris"}, {"name": "Huang Sonia J.", "first_name": "Huang", "last_name": "J."}]}, {"title": "An Explorative Study on the Market Relation Between Online and Print Newspapers", "year": "2002", "journal": "Journal of Media Economics", "volume": "15", "authors": [{"name": "Chyi Hsiang Iris", "first_name": "Chyi", "last_name": "Iris"}, {"name": "Lasorsa Dominic l.", "first_name": "Lasorsa", "last_name": "l."}]}, {"title": "Is Online News an Inferior Good?
