By the late 1960s, however, the feminist movement expanded its outlook and is now committed not only to a material struggle for equal rights and opportunities for women, but has also embarked on \u201ca symbolic conflict about the definitions of femininity\u201d (Van Zoonen 1994, 12).", "In Argentina, media critique has been a prominent part of the feminist movements\u2019 agenda since the return to democracy in 1983, when members of the movement criticized the coverage of the murder of a young woman for failing to focus on the attempted rape (Laudano 2010). Argentine activists advocated the use of the term \u201cfemicide\u201d (femicidio) in order to highlight the extremes of gender violence and differentiate it from other types of violence since the 1990s (Laudano 2010). In 1995, Argentina sent a delegation to the World Conference on Women in Beijing, which recognized the media as a key concern. Demands for the fair representation of women and women\u2019s rights have remained strong ever since. As Chaher explains, while media organizations and unions have been slow to incorporate the ideals promoted by the Beijing Platform, civil society has done a lot to support gender equality in communication, with initiatives such as the #NiUnaMenos movement, the participation in global networks such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG) (2015), and the creation of networks of journalists against sexist communication, such as the \u201cred-PAR\u201d (Chaher 2018).", "This paper examines newspaper coverage of two issues of paramount relevance to the women\u2019s rights movement: sexual and reproductive health and violence against women, from 1995 until 2015, in two print newspapers from Buenos Aires, Argentina. The reformulation of sexual and reproductive health and violence against women as public issues exemplify the ability of the feminist movement to articulate and integrate them to the public agenda and frame them as human rights issues (Howard-Hassmann 2011; Joachim 2003). Both topics used to be perceived as belonging exclusively to the private sphere until the 1980s and, therefore, not subject to regulation (Joachim 2003). During the last two decades of the twentieth century, human rights organizations became responsive to the demands of the international women\u2019s movement and included the demands for freedom from violence and women\u2019s control over their reproduction as a part of women\u2019s fundamental rights (Barnett and Duvall 2005; Krook 2010; Paxton and Hughes 2015).", "The analysis shows that while coverage of violence against women, that is, of any act of gender-based violence that results in harm or suffering of women (UN 1993), increased over the 20-year period, coverage of sexual and reproductive health did not. Moreover, drawing on framing theory, content analysis indicates that, regardless of the level of coverage, throughout the period examined, articles on these topics tended to eschew a gender equality approach, and to be framed in episodic, rather than thematic frames. Finally, articles about violence against women are significantly less likely to use either the equality frame or the thematic frame than stories about sexual and reproductive health.", "This paper draws on these findings to reflect on the relevance of portraying these issues as social concerns with impact in gender equality. The United Nations defines gender equality as the state of equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities for women and men (UN 2001). \u201cEquality does not mean that women and men will become the same but that women\u2019s and men\u2019s rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female\u201d (UN 2001, 1). It is argued that the way the press covers sexual and reproductive health and violence against women is the result of cultural and professional criteria. A reframing of these topics would be beneficial for the advancement of gender equality and women\u2019s rights."]}, {"title": "Women\u2019s Rights Issues on the Media", "paragraphs": ["Studies on news selection and production propose that decisions on what issues to cover, made by individual journalists and news organizations, are socially shaped (Berkowitz 1997). What is considered news depends on individual values, communication routines constrains, organizational forces, understandings about which kinds of events people want to know about and cultural dispositions (Gans 2004; Shoemaker 1997). Research on media and gender suggests that there is a tendency for women to be invisible in media (Gallagher 2002; Ross 2010; Van Zoonen 1988), because the homogenizing effect of journalistic values leave out stories about them (Berkowitz 1997). Some authors suggest that the tendency to ignore and underrepresent women stems from professional criteria and sociocultural guidelines (Gallagher 2002; Ross 2010; Van Zoonen 1988). Researchers propose that topics related to the reality of women are considered of little journalistic interest and thus are left out of journalists\u2019 agenda (Allan, Branston, and Carter 2002; Gill 2007: Ross 2010). For instance, the Global Media Monitoring project (GMMP) found that women constituted only 17% of the people the media spoke about globally in 1995, and although that percentage has increased over time, it has reached its peak of 24% in 2010 and has remained stable ever since (2015).", "Studies of media coverage of women\u2019s rights issues have often delved into the way women and the women\u2019s movement are represented in media (Beck 1998; Howard-Hassmann 2011; Joachim 2003; Turley 2006; Vega Montiel 2014). Other scholars have looked into the visibility of gender inequalities (Berns 2001; Gallagher 2002; Nettleton 2011; Spoor and Schmitt 2011). Empirical studies on gender and health have mainly employed a content analysis approach (Morris and McInerney 2010; Shugg and Liamputtong 1999). Scholarship on this topic finds that when media covers women's health they do so in relation to their reproductive function, linking sexuality to procreation. In this way, heterosexuality and motherhood continue to be framed as the appropriate sexual expression for women (Shalev and Lemish 2013; Podnieks 2012). Women who do not fulfill the ideal of mother-woman, either because of their inability to conceive, their sexuality or their decision not to have children, are portrayed as \u201cbad mothers\u201d and their femininity is delegitimized (Greil, Leitko, and Porter 1988; Kuperberg and Stone 2008; Shalev and Lemish 2013; Shugg and Liamputtong 2002). In Argentina, in contrast to this tendency to link women\u2019s health with procreation, research finds that media content on sexual and reproductive health issues appears to focus on news coverage of abortion, probably due to the fact that abortion is illegal. Literature on this subject indicates that media treatment of abortion is sporadic and focuses generally on specific cases. Moreover, it tends to be framed as a contentious issue, in which proponents and detractors of the decriminalization of abortion hold irreconcilable positions (Carbajal 2009; Petracci 2009).", "Many of the studies on gender violence have approached the topic through either content or discourse analysis (Bullock 2007; Carlyle, Slater, and Chakroff 2008; Meyers 2004) or case studies (Ardovini-Brooker and Caringella-MacDonald 2002; Gilchrist 2010; Korn and Efrat 2004). Scholars have indicated that press coverage tends to normalize gender violence, revolve around dramatic stories of some individuals and ignore the structural conditions of violence against women (Barnett 2014; Greer 2007; Vega Montiel 2014). Media coverage of crime has a tendency to concentrate on the most serious examples of crime and victimization, with violent and sexual cases in the foreground (Greer 2007), as crimes of a sexual nature meet the news reporting criteria that determine which events are visible in the press (Korn and Efrat 2004, 1063)", "Feminist literature on gender based violence and media in Argentina argue that the media reflects androcentric attitudes and values that reinforce the gender inequalities (Ang\u00e9lico et al. 2014; Calce et al. 2015; Chaher and Santoro 2007). Studies of media coverage of violence against women find that media content expose the victims\u2019 personal lives, does not provide context and abounds in gruesome details and tend to blame the victims for the violence inflicted on them (Bonavitta and de Garay Hern\u00e1ndez 2011; Chaher and Santoro 2007). Studies also find that news on gender violence tend to ignore women as sources and therefore \u201cthe woman's voice is blurred, paraphrased by the speech of other actors\u201d (Ang\u00e9lico et al. 2014, 299). These studies tend to focus on argentine press as a whole, even if differences between publications are expected. Studies on these issues tend to focus on print media as a whole, even if research on related issues, such as insecurity, find stark differences among publications (Zunino and Foc\u00e1s 2018).", "Although many researchers have approached these topics there is a dearth of systematic time-series research, which would allow us to ascertain whether coverage has changed. One exception is the GMMP (2015). However, GMMP is conducted every five years during one day, and thus may fail to capture the gradual shifts in media coverage in individual countries. Thus, this work seeks to provide quantitative evidence on the evolution of women's coverage during the last two decades in Argentina, examining coverage of sexual and reproductive health and gender violence in the twenty-year period from 1995 until 2015.", "The starting point was selected because in 1995 the fourth World Conference on Women produced the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPfA), which recognized media as one of 12 \u201ccritical areas of concern\u201d and credited its potential to contribute to the advancement of women (Gallagher 2011). Since the declaration, several authors and reports have studied the document\u2019s impact and effectiveness on media (Cook 1997; Eige 2015; Vega Montiel 2014). Most studies have found that, although women\u2019s presence has increased in media production, representations of women and girls within media content have made limited progress as they continue to be portrayed in stereotypical manners (Gallagher 2002; UN 2015). However, research also indicates that women\u2019s rights have come a long way since then in most countries: both women\u2019s material wellbeing and life expectancy have improved, as well as their political representation and education rates, which have increased (Howard-Hassmann 2011; Inglehart and Norris 2003). In Argentina there is evidence of a progressive increase in the recognition of women's rights after the recovery of democracy and the constitutional reform (Chaher and Santoro 2007). The 1994 constitutional reform granted constitutional hierarchy to international treaties, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). This meant a turning point for wome\u0144s rights (Buvinic and Roza 2004; Pecheny and Petracci 2006). However, the incorporation of sexual and reproductive health rights and protection against gender-based violence to the public debate was not immediate. Protection for these rights was institutionalized a decade later, when laws sanctioned the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation (2002) and the Prevention of Violence Against Women (2009). Changes in the letter of the law do not automatically translate into improvements in the daily lives of women, but they reflect and promote the presence of these topics in the public agenda (Barnum 1985; Burstein 2003; Weldon 2006).", "This paper examines coverage of sexual and reproductive health and violence against women between 1995 and 2015 in two print newspapers from Argentina, Clar\u00edn and P\u00e1gina/12. Argentina is a fruitful national setting to examine coverage of women\u2019s rights issues due to three reasons. First, it is a competitive democracy with a relatively well-developed media system (Fox and Waisbord 2002; Waisbord 2000). Second, in 1995, Argentina sent a delegation to the World Conference on Women in Beijing and set up and Ad-Hoc Committee to follow up on the Plan of Action resulting from the Conference (Decreto 928/98). Demands for enforcement of women\u2019s rights remain strong. In recent years\u2019 gender violence has received increasing attention in Argentina. Its construction as a social problem crystallized in 2015 in the #NiUnaMenos movement (Rovetto 2015). As Mar\u00eda P\u00eda L\u00f3pez, one of the organizers of the movement, expressed \u201cNi una menos (Not one woman less), as a slogan and a demand, named a collective mood, the social buzz of concern whenever a woman was disappeared or killed\u201d (L\u00f3pez 2015). Third, while media critique has been fundamental for the International Women's Movement, coverage of women\u2019s rights has usually focused on developed industrialized democracies from North America and Europe (Bullock 2007; Gilchrist 2010; Korn and Efrat 2004; Shugg and Liamputtong 2002; Podnieks 2012). Journalistic coverage of issues related to women\u2019s rights in Latin America and other developing nations has been scarcely studied."]}, {"title": "News Frames", "paragraphs": ["In addition to examining the amount of coverage dedicated to gender violence and reproductive and sexual health, this paper examines how these topics were framed. Framing refers to the tool journalists have to select certain aspects of reality and make them more visible in the text, to \u201cpromote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation and/or recommend solutions\u201d (Entman 1993, 52). In essence, news frames are specific properties of the text and narration that organize or structure message meaning (Entman 2007; Chong and Druckman 2007). The main premise of framing theory is that the same issue or event may be construed in different ways and that the way it is presented has an effect in how the audience thinks about it (Chong and Druckman 2007; Entman and Rojecki 2001; Scheufele 1999). The relationship between media frames and audiences, however, is not linear: the way audiences think about issues is built from personal experiences and beliefs, interaction with other people and media content (Entman 1993; Scheufele and Tewksbury 2007). Accordingly, research on the framing of news content analyzes the organizational principles that shape discourses (Entman 2007; Semetko and Valkenburg 2000) and the effects these have on audiences (Birkland and Lawrence 2009; Iyengar 1990; Druckman 2001).", "The difference between episodic and thematic framing was first examined by Iyengar (1990), who examined US network coverage of social issues such as poverty, crime, and unemployment from 1981 to 1986, and found that reporting on these topics tends to exhibit episodic framing, which treats issues in terms of a particular event, provides little or no context, and thus responsibility to the individual. In contrast, thematic framing, which places the issue in an abstract social context, leads to a more socially oriented interpretation of the causes and solutions. Many researchers since Iyengars\u2019 seminal work have analyzed the link between media frames and attributions of responsibility for very dissimilar issues such as obesity, attitudes toward older adults and Social Security or poverty (Bullock, Fraser Wyche, and Williams 2001; Springer and Harwood 2015).", "Research indicates that news coverage of crimes tends to be episodic, focuses on the most violent instances of crime and portrays mostly minority males as suspects (Gilliam, Valentino, and Beckmann 2002; Lyon 2009). Findings on the portrayal of gender violence and intimate partner violence are consistent with the larger trend of crime news to be skewed toward episodic framing (Bullock 2007; Carlyle, Slater, and Chakroff 2008; Post, Smith, and Meyer 2009). Media analysis in Argentina also finds that coverage tends to focus on the victim\u2019s personal life, use police sources and ignore the link between violence and the inequality women face in society (Chaher and Santoro 2007).", "Most studies on gender and media have focused on the digital divide and the underrepresentation of women as media producers (Amado 2017; Gallagher 2002; Ross 2010). Research on the coverage of gender equality issues from a framing perspective is scarce. The GMMP is one of the few resources analyzing the media portrayal of gender equality. The 2015 report finds that, even though less than 10% of the stories refer to gender equality and wome\u0144s rights, this proportion appears to be rising since 2005. Indeed, in 2015 the amount of stories that raised issues of gender equality were more than two times higher than in 2005 (GMMP 2005, 2015)."]}, {"title": "Hypotheses", "paragraphs": ["Research indicates that since the signing of the Beijing Declaration there has been progress in women\u2019s human rights throughout the world. In Argentina, the consolidation of these rights in legal documents, social movements and material accomplishments have gained traction since the mid-1990s.

RQ1: Are there differences between coverage of sexual and reproductive health and articles about gender violence in the usage of the thematic or equality frame?", "RQ1: Are there differences between the two newspapers sampled in the usage of the thematic or equality frame?", "RQ1: Are there differences between coverage of sexual and reproductive health and articles about gender violence in the usage of the thematic or equality frame?"]}, {"title": "Methods", "paragraphs": ["Our research aims to examine news coverage of sexual and reproductive health and violence against women between 1995 and 2015.

Clar\u00edn is the newspaper with the highest circulation in Argentina and is part of the country's main media conglomerate (Becerra and Mastrini 2009). Its structure and scope position it as the reference newspaper in Argentina (IVC 2017) and it is at the center of the political spectrum (Amado 2017). P\u00e1gina/12, on the other hand, is relatively new in Argentina's news media system: it was created in 1987, has a liberal stance, is considered a publication with impact on opinion formers and from the beginning opted for a practice of watchdog journalism (Amado 2007, 2017; Waisbord 2000).", "Quantitative content analysis was conducted on all articles about sexual and reproductive health published on the newspapers on the dates sampled. This method was selected because it provides an unobtrusive assessment of media coverage (Graber 1984) and allows the rigorous and systematic study of discourses (Krippendorff 2012). A multistage sampling design was employed to include one week from each odd year (from 1995 to 2015). For each year in our sample, newspapers for each of the 7 days of the week (one Monday, one Tuesday, one Wednesday, etc.) and every other month were included. So, for example, in 1995 the sample includes one Monday in January, one Tuesday in March, one Wednesday in May, etc. After designing this scheme, the dates were elected randomly, i.e. one Monday of the pre-selected month, one Tuesday in another month, and so on. Thus, the sample is systematic in choosing the years, the months and the days of the week -to make sure that every month and day of the week were included- but random for each particular date.1 In order to select the relevant news stories, the complete editions of both print newspapers were revised.2", "Given that the issues analyzed are not prominent in the media\u2019s agenda, this paper uses broad definitions of sexual and reproductive health and violence against women in order to capture the largest amount of news from the newspaper\u2019s copies present in our sample. Violence against women is defined by the UN as \u201cany act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life\u201d (UN 1993).", "\u201cany act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life\u201d (UN 1993).", "Similarly, in Argentina the Law of Integral Protection of women (Law 26.485 2009) defines it as any conduct, action or omission, based on an unequal power relationship that affects women\u2019s life, freedom, dignity personal safety and integrity. Both definitions point at violence against women as a result of gender inequality. Therefore, for a story to be considered as being about violence against women it is not sufficient that the victim is female. Stories about a robbery resulting in a fatal female victim, for example, would not be considered about violence against women. Examples of violence against women are: femicides, battering, sexual harassment, rape and women\u2019s trafficking for sexual exploitation.3", "Sexual and reproductive health was defined by the United Nations reproductive health and rights agency which states that sexual and reproductive health is a general state of physical, mental and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system (UNFPA 2014). Examples of subtopics of sexual and reproductive health are: (In)fertility and assisted reproduction, contraception, abortion, prenatal care, childbirth, postnatal care, sexually transmitted diseases, gynecological care and sex education.4", "Analysis of print media allowed this research to retrieve all the articles published in the sample and use comparable data for the whole 20-year period.

This analysis indicates that news stories published on Clar\u00edn are significantly less likely to be framed in terms of equality (the odds decrease by 78%) or with a thematic rather than episodic focus (the odds decrease by 65%). The findings also show that articles about violence against women are significantly less likely to use either the equality frame (the odds decrease by 68%) (Table 2) or the thematic frame (with a decrease in the odds of 91%) (Table 2).", "Regarding the equality frame, only 21% of the articles in the sample used this framing.

The difference is even larger in Clar\u00edn: 74% of stories on sexual and reproductive health have thematic framing, while only 9% of articles on violence against women use it."]}, {"title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["The analysis of media content about women\u2019s right issues during a 20-year period in two of the most influential newspapers in Argentina indicates that, in spite of the real progress made regarding women\u2019s human rights in Argentina during the period examined, the coverage of these issues was scarce, episodic and failed to adopt an equality frame. While coverage of violence against women did increase, coverage of sexual and reproductive health remained stable throughout the period analyzed. What is more, the nature of the coverage has not changed. Use of thematic and equality frames remains low and stable over the period studied. Likewise, findings show that articles about violence against women are less likely to emphasize issues concerning equality or inequalities between genders or use a thematic frame.", "Framing theory is based on the premise that any story can be told in several ways (Entman 1993). News making and gatekeeping theories analyze how ideology and culture, working routines and the social context influence which stories are selected as news (Berkowitz 1997). Together both theories provide us with a framework to interpret the data we have presented. Journalistic criteria on what is newsworthy plays a role in the reporting of the two topics analyzed.", "The fact that only coverage of violence against women has increased since 1995 - while news about sexual and reproductive health has remained constant - allows us to conclude that its prominence stems from journalistic standards.8 Thus, the increase in news about gender violence originates from news values that emphasize sensational, unexpected and highly emotional events not from an increase in the relevance of gender equality. Moreover, research shows that representation of crime in general in the news media has increased during the last ten years of the period studied (Calzado 2015; Martini 2012; Kessler and Focas 2014). Zunino and Foc\u00e1s analyze coverage of crime in Argentine media and propose that Quantitative growth was accompanied by a qualitative transition (\u2026) news has has acquired new characteristics: generalization (we are always at risk everywhere and everywhere), fragmentation (an episodic account of each event, without context or general causes), and an increasing focus on the victims (2018, 4).", "Quantitative growth was accompanied by a qualitative transition (\u2026) news has has acquired new characteristics: generalization (we are always at risk everywhere and everywhere), fragmentation (an episodic account of each event, without context or general causes), and an increasing focus on the victims (2018, 4).", "The findings from this 20-year period in Argentina do not differ from research conducted in other countries: issues related to women\u2019s rights are only newsworthy when women are victims of violent crimes (Barnett 2014; Greer 2007; Vega Montiel 2014). Media coverage of violence against women in Argentinian press is consistent with the pattern found by other researchers in other countries (Carlyle, Slater, and Chakroff 2008; Greer 2007; Korn and Efrat 2004; Post, Smith, and Meyer 2009): it tends to focus on femicides and uses episodic frames and even novelistic undertones.", "Newspaper coverage of sexual and reproductive health is scarce during the period and less prominent in Clarin\u2019s agenda. Although there are differences between both newspapers, which may stem from differences in their ideological stances, coverage of sexual and reproductive health and employment of thematic and equality frame does not increase in the period studied for either newspaper. That P\u00e1gina/12 - a newspaper associated to the human rights movement - did not increase its coverage of sexual and reproductive health issues or its\u2019 usage of gender equality and thematic frames exposes how pervasive are organizational and professional principles that shape media content.", "The sidelining of reproductive and sexual health issues and the prevalence of stories focusing on the exceptional cases of violence against women is a cause of concern when analyzing the presence of women\u2019s rights issues in the public agenda. On the one hand, the paucity of media stories on topics such as fertility, contraception, abortion and STD\u2019s is telling of the little importance given to such issues. What is more, the lack of information about sexual and reproductive health is detrimental for women\u2019s right to autonomy in exercising life choices. On the other hand, the portrayal of violence against women as isolated cases where only individuals are held responsible allows for the common sense notion that aggressors are \u201cmonsters\u201d, not a product of patriarchy and rape culture. If episodic framing of violence against women promotes the allocation of responsibility to the individual - as it has been proved to do in other issues such as poverty (Iyengar 1990)- then the prevalence of this type of framing is unfavorable to the implementation of public policies and legislation against gender based violence. Thus, even when issues regarding women\u2019s rights are part of news-media organizations agenda, this does not necessarily mean the deconstruction of structural inequalities faced by women.", "While the findings presented in this paper resonate with current research on the topic, this study is not without limitations. Content analysis allows researchers to study discourses systematically and describe patterns. However, it does not make it possible to infer \u201cany particular reading of an audience\u201d of the media messages (Bauer 2000, 134). Thus, future research should inquire into the impact of both sets of frames on audiences. Furthermore, literature on women\u2019s rights issues on Argentinian media would benefit from other systematic and longitudinal studies analyzing other media and topics.", "Common sense leads to the idea that gender inequalities will tend to disappear over time and that these changes should be evident in media content. Analysis of the coverage of women\u2019s rights issues in Argentina from 1995 to 2015, however, expose the persistence of cultural and professional patterns that marginalize stories about women\u2019s rights issues on media. Journalistic values and sociocultural guidelines seem to have a homogenizing effect that persist over time (Berkowitz 1997). As Shoemaker explains, news-production cannot escape the fact that it is interrelated with the larger social system (1997). Therefore, as long as journalistic values on what is newsworthy and how stories should be told remain the same, and as long as society at large does not change, mass media content will still favor stories where women are portrayed as victims of isolated crimes and will ignore other topics and frames.", "This study suggests that the mere presence of these issues on the media does not entail visibility of the inequalities women face. In fact, not all coverage of women\u2019s right issues is beneficial to the advancement of the women\u2019s movement. When news lacks an equality approach and thematic frame and, instead, focuses on prurient details, it might even perpetuate and legitimize inequality. This research set out to study how much had media changed over the last twenty years. When it comes to women, not much."]}], "references": [{"title": "Las periodistas desde los estudios del periodismo: perfiles profesionales de las mujeres en los medios informativos", "year": "2017", "journal": "Cuestiones de g\u00e9nero: de la igualdad y la diferencia", "volume": "12", "authors": [{"name": "Amado Adriana.", "first_name": "Amado", "last_name": "Adriana."}]}, {"title": "Femicide and Gender Violence in Argentina Press: An Analysis of Voices, Stories and Actors", "year": "2014", "journal": "Universitas Human\u00edstica", "volume": "78", "authors": [{"name": "Ang\u00e9lico Rocio", "first_name": "Ang\u00e9lico", "last_name": "Rocio"}, {"name": "Dikenstein Violeta", "first_name": "Dikenstein", "last_name": "Violeta"}, {"name": "Fischberg Sabrina", "first_name": "Fischberg", "last_name": "Sabrina"}, {"name": "Maffeo Florencia", "first_name": "Maffeo", "last_name": "Florencia"}]}, {"title": "Media Attributions of Blame and Sympathy in ten Rape Cases", "year": "2002", "journal": "The Justice Professional", "volume": "15", "authors": [{"name": "Ardovini-Brooker Joanne", "first_name": "Ardovini-Brooker", "last_name": "Joanne"}, {"name": "Caringella-MacDonald Susan", "first_name": "Caringella-MacDonald", "last_name": "Susan"}]}, {"title": "Framing.
