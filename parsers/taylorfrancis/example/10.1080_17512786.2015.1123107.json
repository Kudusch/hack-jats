While crowdfunding is often positioned as empowering for both the journalists and donors, what is often overlooked is the amount and type of labour involved in crowdfunding. This article examines labour in crowdfunding from three vantage points: the labour involved in the campaign itself, the labour of the donors and the type of labour crowdfunding enables. This paper argues that the amount of work is akin to having a second full-time job. Moreover, having to embrace entrepreneurial techniques and market their work is something many journalists are uncomfortable with. Further, this paper examines how donors are implicated in the labour of journalism, and how journalists are hoping to \u201ccommodify\u201d the audience. Finally, this paper addresses how crowdfunding does afford journalists agency, enabling them to work outside of legacy news structures, which many journalists find liberating.", "body": [{"title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["As legacy news organizations struggle with cuts and closures, and journalism jobs become increasingly hard to come by (McChesney and Pickard 2011), the idea that crowdfunding may be a viable way of financing journalism has gained momentum (Aitamurto 2015; Carvajal, Garc\u00eda-Avil\u00e9s, and Gonz\u00e1lez 2012; Hunter 2015; Jian and Usher 2014). Much of the hype around crowdfunding is fuelled by high-profile cases. For instance, in 2012 the online science and technology magazine Matter raised US$140,000 on Kickstarter, over three times what was asked for. In a similarly high-profile and successful campaign that same year, a former National Public Radio (NPR) journalist raised over $100,000 to start an independent publication to cover Washington politics. More recently, in 2014, the collective Radiotopia raised over $600,000 to fund independent radio shows and podcasts. Along with these big success stories, entrepreneurial hope is buoyed by a plethora of more modest examples; journalists raising anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars to support freelance travel budgets, create documentaries or start online independent ventures (Aitamurto 2011; Hunter 2015). Crowdfunding has been touted as something that journalists can turn to when money is tight, jobs are scarce and becoming an entrepreneur is perhaps the best or only option (Zara 2013). While cautioning that crowdfunding is not a replacement for legacy business models, Aitamurto (2015, 203) still sees crowdfunding as playing \u201can important role in the emerging new business model ecosystem in journalism\u201d, not just because it can help journalists raise money, but because it is a marketing tool that can help journalists brand themselves, test story ideas and attract audiences. However, what is often overlooked amidst the hope and the possibility in crowdfunding, is the amount and the type of labour involved. This labour is often extremely time consuming and exhausting, forcing journalists to act in ways they are not accustomed to and, in many cases, not comfortable with. Moreover, although there has been some research examining the motivation of contributors to crowdfunding campaigns (Aitamurto 2011; Jian and Usher 2014; Jian and Shin 2015), there has not been critical scholarship to date that theorizes how donors contribute to the labour of crowdfunding.", "Based on interviews with journalists in Canada and the United States who have crowdfunded, this article examines the labour involved in crowdfunding and journalism from three vantage points. First, it examines labour from the journalist's perspective and argues that the amount of labour involved is akin to a second full-time job. Further, it examines the type of work that crowdfunding entails, particularly the difficulties journalists experience as they try to embrace the often-conflicting values of public affairs journalism and business. Most journalists are used to pitching stories to editors or producers, but having to become entrepreneurs and sell an idea to potential funders before they can even begin the work of reporting is not something most are used to or comfortable with. In particular, they find it difficult to be publicly transparent about their story ideas before they have been fully formed and produced. They also are not used to having to market their work and justify why it is worthy of funding. Second, this article addresses the labour of donors. While crowdfunding could be characterized as empowering for the \u201cformer audience\u201d (Gillmor 2004), drawing on Dallas Smythe's (1981) theory of the \u201caudience commodity\u201d and more recent theorizing of the \u201cprosumer commodity\u201d (Fuchs 2012a, 2012b), the article argues that one goal of crowdfunding is the commodification of audiences. Many journalists raising seed money for online publications are hoping to leverage donor interest into advertising dollars. Essentially, they hope to \u201csell\u201d their donors to advertisers as proof their publication is worth supporting. Finally, the article addresses the type of work crowdfunding enables, arguing that it can be empowering, affording journalists a sense of agency in that they are able to create work outside of legacy news structures. However, I also argue that crowdfunding is a form of what Kuehn and Corrigan (2013) have called \u201chope labour\u201d, through which journalists are hoping to create brands, recognition and harness audience attention that they can then leverage into a more sustainable funding model."]}, {"title": "Crowdfunding Models in Journalism", "paragraphs": ["At its core, crowdfunding is a process whereby small amounts of money are solicited from a large pool of people, in order to support a project or an endeavour (Bannerman 2013). Although today crowdfunding is shorthand for online fundraising, crowdfunding is not something exclusive to the internet (Bannerman 2013; Jian and Usher 2014). It has been common practice for public broadcasters to ask audiences for monetary support. For NPR in the United States, this is a tradition that goes back decades (Aitamurto 2011). The difference with online crowdfunding is that it is easier for individual journalists who do not have large institutional support behind them to connect directly with potential funders (Hunter 2015; Jian and Shin 2015). For freelancers in particular, crowdfunding has been touted as one way to support their work in a financial climate where resources are scarce (Carvajal, Garc\u00eda-Avil\u00e9s, and Gonz\u00e1lez 2012). Aitamurto (2015) argues that in addition to financial support, crowdfunding also acts as a marketing tool, helping journalists build their brand and bring in audiences who will then perhaps consume and support their work in the future.", "There are four main models of crowdfunding: equity based, lending based, reward based and donation based (Aitamurto 2015; Bannerman 2013; Mollick 2014). In equity- and lending-based models, investors give with the expectation, and hope, that there will be some sort of financial return on their donation. In lending-based models funders expect their money back, with interest (Aitamurto 2015). In equity-based models investors expect to share in the revenue of the project (Aitamurto 2015; Bannerman 2013). The crowdfunding models typically used in journalism are donation based, where contributors donate altruistically without expectation of compensation of any sort, or rewards based, where donors are compensated based on the amount they are willing to donate. The rewards are tier based, with journalists offering small rewards for smaller donations, such as postcards or small gifts from places they have travelled to cover a story, and larger rewards for more substantial donations, rewards such as advance copies or exclusive access to their work.", "Aitamurto (2015) has identified four categories of crowdfunding specific to journalism. The first is raising funds to cover a single story; journalists turn to crowdfunding platforms to pitch a story idea with the hopes that the money raised will cover the reporting costs. Often freelance journalists who want to raise money to travel to cover a particular story will use this model. The second is crowdfunding for \u201ccontinuous coverage\u201d or a \u201cbeat\u201d. The third model is raising money for a new venture, whether an online platform or publication. The goal here is to raise seed funding. Finally, there are journalists who are crowdfunding to support endeavours that are outside of actual journalism, but will support their work. An example is a Kickstarter campaign run by The San Francisco Public Press\u2014an independent online investigative magazine\u2014that raised over $20,000 to support delivery of their newspaper by bicycle.", "When audiences are directly funding the news, it raises questions about the nature of the relationship between audience and journalist. The argument can be made that with their investments donors are now, in a sense, producers of the news. While some contend donors are producers who do not have editorial control (Carvajal, Garc\u00eda-Avil\u00e9s, and Gonz\u00e1lez 2012), the reality is perhaps much more nuanced. Journalists who crowdfund feel a great deal of responsibility towards their funders (Aitamurto 2011), and an onus to create work their donors will be pleased with (Hunter 2015). Initial research has also found that while some journalists feel very strongly that their donors should have no editorial control over the content, others are open to more dialogue with their funders and are crowdfunding, in part, because they want input on the journalistic process (Hunter 2015). As well, outreach and community building are essential elements of crowdfunding, which can be at odds with keeping donors at arm's length from editorial content (Hunter 2015).", "To date there has not been a great deal of research that looks closely at the type of labour involved in crowdfunding. Aitamurto (2015) does note that in crowdfunding journalists publicly pitch their ideas, which requires journalists to be more transparent about their work. As well, in an earlier study Aitamurto (2011) found that journalists sometimes feel uncomfortable about having to promote their story ideas through social networks. Noting that her study involved a small sample of seven journalists, Aitamurto has called this observation \u201cinitial\u201d and \u201ctentative\u201d (440), and encourages that this be treated as a hypothesis and explored in further studies. Taking a cue from this research, this article will look more closely at the labour involved in crowdfunding, particularly the amount and the type of work involved.", "There has been some initial research that has examined the motivations of donors and what type of journalism tends to get funded. Trasel and Fontoura (2015, 99), comparing the stories published using Spot.us with the usual coverage in the American press, found that it is \u201ca viable alternative for publishing more different points of view, as well as subjects and themes\u201d. Jian and Usher (2014), in their study of Spot.us, found that both experienced and inexperienced journalists seem to get funded, which they point to as hopeful for young journalists who are looking for a way to start their careers. Research has also found that donors are often motivated by altruistic reasons; they want to donate to journalism that will have impact and make a difference (Aitamurto 2011; Jian and Shin 2015). This paper will look at donors from a different perspective, arguing that journalists are hoping to commodify the audience. Finally, it will look at the type of work that crowdfunding enables, particularly how journalists are able to create work outside of mainstream legacy structures, a move they find empowering, despite the sheer amount of work it entails."]}, {"title": "The Audience Commodity and Agency", "paragraphs": ["By drawing on theories of the prosumer commodity (Fuchs 2012a, 2012b) and the audience commodity (Smythe 1981), we can contextualize the role of donors in crowdfunding. While there has been some research that points to donors as investors and producers, many journalists are hoping to use the interest of donors as leverage to move into an advertising model\u2014essentially commodifying the audience. The theory of the audience commodity goes back to Dallas Smythe (1981). As Fuchs (2012b, 695) writes, \u201cFor Smythe, the material aspect of communications is that audiences work, are exploited and sold as commodities\u201d. In other words, the commodity produced by media was not the show, or the broadcast, but rather the audience, which was then sold to advertisers in the form of ratings. Further to this, the audience was working by paying attention to advertisements\u2014the television or radio programme is simply the \u201cfree lunch\u201d offered as enticement to pay attention to the advertisements. As Pridmore and Trottier (2014, 139) describe, the type of work audiences engage in is an \u201cimmaterial form of labour\u201d and by paying attention to advertisements audiences learn \u201cto buy goods and to spend their income accordingly\u201d. Key to Smythe's theorizing was that audiences may be labouring, without explicit knowledge that they are doing so (Pridmore and Trottier 2014).", "The audience commodity was\u2014and continues to be\u2014controversial, principally around the question of whether audiences actually work; consuming media, even advertising, is often thought of as a leisure activity. Some argue that an audience commodity analysis downplays audience agency (Caraway 2011). While it is perhaps more difficult to make the argument that consuming mass media is in fact work, with social media the argument is much more easily made, as these platforms would not exist without input from audiences. Fuchs (2012a) uses the term \u201cprosumer commodities\u201d to describe social media users who fill up these platforms with their creative work, whose data are then collected and sold to advertisers. Rather than positioning social media as a democratizing and empowering force, one that fosters creativity, Fuchs counters that social media, such as Facebook, is actually working towards the \u201ctotal commodification of human creativity\u201d (56).", "In the case of crowdfunding, the question of whether donors are working, and what type of agency they might have, could be similarly contested. The role of the donor is often positioned as one that is empowering\u2014audiences have the opportunity to put their money behind journalism they feel is worthwhile. They can have an impact on journalism, and by extension democracy if one believes the media to be an important part of the democratic process. However, while this may be the case during the initial crowdfunding campaign, what this article will argue is that some journalists are hoping to leverage donor interest into proof to advertisers that there is an audience for their work, effectively \u201cselling\u201d their audience to advertisers, with the expectations that this audience will eventually work by paying attention to advertisements and learning to become consumers."]}, {"title": "Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Interviews were conducted with freelance and independent journalists in Canada and the United States. Three Canadians and 24 Americans were interviewed. The sample included 16 women and 11 men. The interview sample was drawn from crowdfunding pitches that were accessible online between September 2013 and June 2015 on Kickstarter (N\u2009=\u200919), Indiegogo (N\u2009=\u20096) and Spot.us (N\u2009=\u20092). Although some journalists are now experimenting with continued crowdfunding from donors, either through their own websites or through platforms such as Patreon, this research is restricted to journalists who have conducted crowdfunding campaigns where the goal is to raise a specific amount of money, not secure ongoing funding. This choice was made, in part to keep the sample specific to a certain type of crowdfunding, but also because this type of crowdfunding is fairly established and well known, thus attracting a range of journalists.", "Most of the journalists ran at least one successful campaign; however, one journalist had run both an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign and a successful one. Three journalists were also only partially funded on Indiegogo, a platform that offers a \u201cflexible funding\u201d option where people can collect whatever they raise. The journalists who used Indiegogo were drawn to this platform because of this option, preferring to avoid Kickstarter's \u201call-or-nothing\u201d policy, and the relatively low rate of success on the latter platform. As of October 2015, Kickstarter statistics show that a total of 694 journalism projects have been successfully funded, while 2294 have been unsuccessful. The crowdfunding campaigns in this study ran between 2011 and 2015, and raised funds that ranged between US$1500 and $76,000. The age range of the participants was between 24 and 56. The journalists had a range of professional experience. Eleven had worked in legacy media and were now freelancing or with independent media; eight were career freelancers; three had always worked in independent media; and five had no previous experience in journalism. The funds were used to start independent online publications (N\u2009=\u20096), support travel expenses for freelance journalism aimed at both independent and legacy media (N\u2009=\u20097), create documentaries and books (N\u2009=\u20093), fund reporting for specific stories in independent publications (N\u2009=\u20099), and purchase office space and equipment (N\u2009=\u20092).", "Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted between November 2013 and June 2015. The interviews took place over the phone or through Skype. The interviews lasted between 20 and 90 minutes; the average length was 45 minutes. The purpose of semi-structured interviews is to explore themes or issues of interest to the research, while allowing space for participants to discuss ideas that they find particularly relevant. The interview questions were designed to draw out participants\u2019 thoughts about their motivation to crowdfund, how they found the experience, particularly the amount and nature of work involved, as well as the interactions they had with their funders. At the same time, within this flexible structure, interviewees were encouraged to expand on issues of particular interest, and bring up new ideas that the researcher did not specifically ask about. As Johnson and Rowlands (2012, 100) describe, the goal of in-depth semi-structured interviews is to understand a person's \u201clived experience\u201d and particular \u201cperspective\u201d.", "The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach, with the goal of finding patterns from the participants\u2019 \u201cthick descriptions\u201d elicited in the interviews (Hesse-Biber and Leavy 2006, 119). The tool of analysis was analytic memo writing (Corbin and Strauss 2008; Lindolf and Taylor 2011). A process of open coding was used in the first step of analysis where the transcripts were first read for emergent themes, concepts and categories (Charmaz 2006; Corbin and Strauss 2008; Hesse-Biber and Leavy 2006; Holton 2007; Lindolf and Taylor 2011). As a second step axial coding was used to make connections between categories, particularly to find links and relate \u201cminor concepts to broader level concepts\u201d (Corbin and Strauss 2008, 193). As a final step the subcategories were integrated into analytic categories. As the focus of this article is on labour and crowdfunding, this paper will deal with the categories that emerged from the data that deal with various forms of labour. The first category is \u201clabour and the campaign\u201d, which includes two subcategories: \u201cdesign and outreach\u201d which deals with the amount of labour involved in campaigns and \u201ctransparency and marketing\u201d which deals with the type of labour involved. The second category is \u201clabour and donors\u201d which focuses on the commodification of the donors. The final category is \u201clabour and agency\u201d which focuses on the freedom many journalists feel that crowdfunding affords."]}, {"title": "Labour of the Campaign", "paragraphs": ["All the journalists in this research study described the amount of labour that goes into crowdfunding as extremely time consuming. First, there is a great deal of work that goes into design of a campaign, principally around writing the pitch and producing video, developing an appropriate rewards system, and designing an overall marketing plan for outreach. Second, the campaign itself is all encompassing, as successful campaigns require intensive social media outreach and contacting donors directly through email.", "Beginning with the design of the campaign, many journalists said that the work involved is so intense and requires a diverse skill set that it helps to work as part of a team. The type of labour involved in designing a campaign includes not only writing the pitch, but also producing compelling video and graphics. It is often difficult for one person to do this alone. One journalist said her campaign was successful because she was working with people who had professional writing and design skills. As she described: \u201cFortunately, we're writers so it's not like we had to go hire somebody to write our Kickstarter for us. But it was still a ton of work\u2009\u2026\u2009 It was completely insane. I would never do it again\u201d (Journalist, $76,000 raised on Kickstarter).", "The type of labour involved also included thinking about marketing, particularly designing a system of rewards that would entice people to donate. When crowdfunding for a creative product such as a movie or a game, there are obvious rewards, such as the marketing material that goes along with the product, or the product itself. With journalism, it is more difficult to offer a \u201cproduct\u201d as a reward. First, for journalists who are crowdfunding to cover a single story, particularly an investigative story, it is not always obvious from the beginning what the end product will be. Second, for journalists who are crowdfunding to start an online publication, often the goal is for the publication to be freely available, so the \u201cproduct\u201d cannot be offered as something exclusive. Journalists said they had to think creatively to come up with incentives. The freelance journalists who were raising funds to travel would often offer postcards or trinkets from the places they were travelling. Some journalists also decided to offer exclusive content, or advance copies of their work. For the highest donors, some journalists offered their own company as a reward\u2014either by offering themselves as a speaker for an event, or offering to go for dinner or drinks with donors. However, because many found it difficult to think about tangible rewards that would be big draws, they often decided to focus on appealing to a donor's interest in the story or the publication itself.", "For example, one journalist who ran a campaign to fund a feminist online publication said she eventually decided it was best to focus on appealing to a donor's desire to see a women's magazine that did not focus on celebrity content. She said there were other people running crowdfunding campaigns for feminist magazines who were able to offer what she calls \u201cbig ticket\u201d rewards, such as consultation with a writer for a well-known television programme. However, since she did not have these types of contacts, she had to think differently about what she could offer: Of course the rewards are really one of the best ways to bring people in to back your projects. So that was something I really had to sit down and think about. For me ultimately it was\u2014\u201cOK, well I don't really have the ability to offer these big ticket items necessarily, so I'm going to focus on offering exclusive or early access to our content and more fun rewards that are sort of related to [magazine]\u201d. But it also made me realize maybe my rewards aren't my main draw. I really need to focus on getting people behind [magazine's] mission in general and having that being our selling point.

For the month of the campaign journalists have to use social media constantly to reach out to potential donors and advertise their campaign. They primarily use Twitter and Facebook to reach out to their personal networks and provide updates as the campaign proceeds. They also use their personal contacts to email potential donors individually. They spend a great deal of time thanking donors and providing updates, in the hopes that donors will make a second donation once they see that the campaign is progressing. All the journalists agreed that outreach is a key component of crowdfunding and that this process of updating social media and reaching out to contacts is the most demanding part of the process. It is not enough to simply build a site and expect people to find it. It is imperative to focus on reaching out to people who may be interested in your journalism and also able to donate. Then you have to stay plugged into social media for the month of the campaign to keep up the outreach. As one journalist observed\u2014you cannot send one message out and think it is enough, the process of social media outreach is really about building relationships with donors. You have to have a solid plan for outreach. That's building partnerships, which is a lot of phone calls, a lot of emails, a lot of meetings, a lot of research and contacting people who would be interested. Social media. It's a lot of work.

As she described: \u201cThe month of the campaign was really a marketing campaign more than just a money campaign. We knew we had to email people and be on Facebook and be on Twitter\u201d (Journalist, $11,600 raised on Kickstarter). Another journalist said that outreach is so important to crowdfunding, she thinks it is essential to have a social media expert working as part of a campaign. A good tip would be to have someone in your pocket who knows about social media and how to promote it. Because you can write the best copy, and have the best video but if you don't have a way to promote it and get people to see it, it's not going to go anywhere. It's not going to be successful.

As this journalist describes, crowdfunding at the same time that he was working his regular jobs was overwhelming. \u201cIt nearly killed me to make it happen. On top of running the site and the other jobs I do because I don't get paid enough by [current employer], it was an extraordinary effort\u201d (Journalist, $20,000 raised on Indiegogo). Similarly, another journalist described the process as extremely time consuming and stressful. \u201cIt is exhausting.

It's constant plugging and pushing\u201d (Journalist, $47,500 raised on Kickstarter).", "Many journalists said they were very surprised by the amount of work it was to stay on top of social media outreach, and also thanking and responding to donors. They had been drawn to crowdfunding after hearing success stories, and cautioned that these stories belie the amount of effort these campaigns take. As this journalist describes: I think what's happened with crowdsourced funding is people are hearing about the big stories\u2014the movies that get made, the Planet Money NPR project which raised $500,000 to do a t-shirt. Podcasts that have raised $100,000. What they don't tell you is those people are very, very lucky. Doing a crowdfunded project takes a lot of work and a lot of personal outreach.

At the beginning [my successful crowdfunding campaign] wasn't doing terribly well, so [Kickstarter] put it on their front page because they liked the project.

Having to pitch your idea to a public of strangers and convince them to fund your work is something these journalists found difficult to get used to. As one journalist described, she felt very uncomfortable being so transparent about her work. It did not come naturally to her, and she had to wrestle with the idea that her idea might be rejected or critiqued in a public way. It was really uncomfortable at the beginning.

Crowdfunding allowed her to raise enough money to produce stories on her own. For other freelancers, the motivation to crowdfund was to raise enough so that they could make money in an economic climate where freelance budgets of legacy media organizations are drying up or non-existent. For instance, one journalist says he now uses a hybrid model to finance his freelance journalism\u2014he gets some funds from legacy media, but also raises funds through crowdfunding so that he can be guaranteed to make some money.

Both the design of the campaign and the outreach involved takes a great deal of time and energy, requiring journalists to tap into their networks of families, friends and colleagues. The process of asking for money on a public platform also makes many journalists uncomfortable. Having to become entrepreneurs who are effectively \u201cselling\u201d their idea to a wider public is at odds with the work routines and norms most journalists are used to. As Kawamoto (2003, 23) describes: \u201cIn traditional news organizations, there is a metaphorical firewall between the advertising and editorial functions of a news medium\u201d. In crowdfunding, of course, this firewall between the money and the journalists no longer exits; what journalists are able to create depends entirely on how well they market and sell their ideas. While some journalists have embraced becoming more transparent and public about their process, seeing this as part of the move to involve audiences more in the news process, many feel very awkward about asking for money and marketing their work. Aitamurto (2011) found that younger journalists were more comfortable with the process than older journalists, however, in this research both less experienced and more experienced journalists felt awkward about marketing their work, or as one journalist described, having to \u201cask for permission\u201d from the public before beginning their reporting (Journalist, $2200 raised on Kickstarter). This move towards entrepreneurial journalism goes against the norms under which most journalists are used to operating.", "Alongside this sense of discomfort in the entrepreneurial space, however, some journalists do feel empowered at being able to work outside of legacy media. This affords journalists a sense of agency, a sense that they have power and can change, even in some small way, how journalism is done. Most are crowdfunding because they want to tell stories that they feel are not being reported, or are underreported in legacy media. Many journalists speak very positively about the freedom they feel crowdfunding gives them in this regard.", "It may well be, however, that many of these journalists are engaging in what Kuehn and Corrigan (2013) call \u201chope\u201d labour. As they describe, hope labour is \u201cun- or under-compensated work carried out in the present, often for experience or exposure, in the hope that future employment opportunities may follow\u201d (21). In this research study most journalists said they do not make a lot of money from crowdfunding and do not see it as a sustainable long-term way to raise funding. Rather, they are hoping that crowdfunding will be the start of full-time employment. If they are raising funds to start an online publication, many are hoping that they will be able to make this their full-time job by securing advertising or large investor funding. As argued previously, essentially these journalists are hoping to \u201csell\u201d their donors to advertisers and make the case that advertisers should invest in their publication, because they have a proven audience. This process fits with theories of the audience commodity (Smythe 1981), in that key to this process is the idea that donors will become audiences, who will then \u201cwork\u201d paying attention to advertisements. In a sense, they can also be considered \u201cprosumer commodities\u201d (Fuchs 2012a, 2012b) as they have helped produce the journalism in the first place, by funding it. As discussed, theories of the audience commodity are controversial, and with crowdfunding the case can be made that donors are freely giving their attention and their money to journalists. In one sense, this is empowering, but becomes murkier as journalists hope to leverage donor attention into advertising revenue. In the case of journalists who are starting their careers, and more seasoned freelancers, they are hoping that crowdfunding will bolster sagging freelance budgets and allow them to either get their start as a journalist, or continue as freelancers. While in one sense this could be characterized as empowering, in another, drawing on Cohen's (2012) research into the exploitation of freelance journalists, crowdfunding is also a way for news organizations to get more work out of freelance employees for less money. If freelancers are turning to crowdfunding, and all the labour this entails, in order to make freelancing financially viable, news organizations that use this form of journalism are profiting from unpaid labour. While crowdfunding can work well for journalists who have the energy to invest in the process, and who have small, finite projects in mind, such as start-up funds or travel funds, it is not a long-term solution to the economic uncertainty facing the field. It is, however, a place where start-ups and experiments can secure initial funding, and perhaps go on to leverage further funding through traditional advertising models or philanthropic support."]}, {"title": "Limitations and Further Research", "paragraphs": ["This research has focused for the most part on relatively well-established one-off crowdfunding sites, where norms and protocols have developed.

There is likely much to be learned from past experiments in crowdfunding platforms aimed specifically at journalists that are now defunct, such as Contributoria, a site for freelance journalists, Vourno, a site for video journalists, and Indie Voices, which targeted independent journalism.
